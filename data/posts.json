    "body" : "**Re-posting here because of lack of activity in /r/AskIndia**\n\nHello,\n\nLast year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of \"Insurance\" rather than \"Investment\".\n\nSo as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.\n\n2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.\n\n3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay \"twice\" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.\n\n4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?\n\n2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?\n\n3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?\n\nPlease help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)\n",

    "body" : "Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for \"extra\" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!\n\nWe drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.\n\nHowever, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.\n\nExcuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?\n\nShe explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were \"crossed wires\", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.\n\nWhat is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nI  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in \"interaction design\", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",

Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? \n\nEven if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nmake sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.\n\nas an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  \"We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)\" r/iamverysmart individuals.  \nmoreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say \"cannot be done because of bad mood\".   \nan embassy is not your regular post office branches. the productivity level despite being in perpetual shortage of stuff is inspiring for all other government branches.  \nif you have any kind of proof about your claims of misbehaviour- get out of anonymity & go for appropriate mechanism.    \nif you don't know the mechanism - pm me your proof - i will provide you.",

Not saying that this behaviour is exclusive to us, but I'm sure a lot of us have witnessed this first hand. What's the worst incident you recall first hand of Indian folks behaving badly abroad?\n\nFor me:\n\n1. Our flight was awaiting departure at the Malaysia airport. Suddenly, the weather turned bad and it started raining very heavily on the runway. The pilot announced that there would be a delay of few minutes due to weather conditions. Hardly 2 mins later, this Indian lady - a honeymooner from her looks, gets up and starts yelling at the crew. \"Explain to me what is the issue\", \"what is the estimated time for fixing the issue\", \"Oh so our time has no value after paying so much money?\"... BC pakka some IT mid level manager who kept yelling to \"fix issue asap\" at the poor crew. Her husband was of course supportive and joined her in the shouting match. Eventually, it took some co-passengers to calm them down.\n2. Possibly the worst people to board a plane could be found on the Bangkok route. Groups and groups of crass middle aged men making lewd comments about the air hostess, or hell, even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny. Even more tharkis asking their co-passengers where to get the best \"maal\".\n3. Seen many people throwing trash on the streets (habit from India), being obnoxious to other tourists (mocking them for their physical appearance or ethnicity) and sharing like 1 beer amongst 5 people. While in Pattaya, a HUGE number of establishments (strip clubs, bars and lounges) turn away Indians for these reasons. If they see brown guys approaching, they just tell them \"Sorry, members only\".\n4. Reasonably well behaved in hard-assed Singapore. I wonder why...\n5. On a flight to Dubai, after the flight took off, a Muslim guy got up and started looking for something in the overhead compartment. So, this moron sitting next to me calls the air hostess and asks her to check what he is doing. \"Bomb nikla toh?\" he said that so loudly that even the Muslim man heard it. Turns out, the Muslim man was just taking out his lunch box. \"Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin\", he said while getting back to his seat.",

Oh man. So there was a huge line in Bangkok for boarding pass and everybody was standing still in line while some impatient people of my own country literally unhinged the rope from the pole and got in between.\nEverybody fucking followed and got in the middle. The airline crew had to come and maintain decorum. The white guys just stood surprised. I was at the Chicago airport and some elderly women sitting across me at the gate, loudly, in my native language (Telugu), started gossiping to each other about what I wearing (sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie). After like a minute or two I told them in Telugu I can understand everything they're saying and to mind their own business and they had the audacity to tell me I don't know how to speak to elders. Changing a baby's diapers on an empty seat WHILE PEOPLE AROUND ARE HAVING THEIR MEALS. \n\nI've never seen a flight attendant so upset; he had to almost drag the mother to the washroom (where they have baby-tending facilities) >even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny.\n\nWhat the actual fuck. Cutting into queueus, gets on my nerves every time ! > \"Bomb nikla toh?\"\n\nSecurity check-ins are just a casual formality for him. Not Abroad but an asshole Indian family from abroad spotted at Delhi airport. I landed from Leh and was super hungry and late because my previous flight landed late. This family argues on the counter while taking boarding pass asking for a free upgrade. Upon asking why sir, Have you bought an upgrade ? Their reply was \"actually we're from US\". Whenever I go to india from Tokyo to Delhi via Thailand, the difference between the two legs of the journey is huge... Had gone to Switzerland and there were a lot of Indians. On Jungfraujoch, there was this middle aged guy who shouted in the loudest voice I’ve heard: “IS THIS VEG!?!?” Everyone looked at him but he didn’t give a shit. Since he was evidently not going to apologize, I went and did the good deed. Someone from the same group was trying to score a mini bottle of Red Label for free even though you had to pay for it. Their argument was that “we have bought so much food, we should get one for free.” Eventually the cashier got hella pissed and refused to serve them. \n\nWhen I read the the rules that the Swiss hotel had put up, I wasn’t surprised. That’s not racism people, a lot of travelers are just rude and entitled. This didn't happen to me, but when my SO was flying to Dubai, there was a middle-aged Indian man who was sitting next to her (with one seat gap between them). He straight up grabbed food from my SO's meal saying don't mind no? He also proceeded to fight for more free alcohol after having like some four pegs before.\n\nI was glad there was a seat between him and my SO and she got out safely but man, you tend to meet some really creepy people on flights.\n\nI have also seen Indian families just walk to plug points in airports and proceed to remove other peoples charging paraphernalia just like that, without asking them and then put their own chargers there. After that, they proceed to beg saying please please and then hog that port until the end of time.",

    "comment" : " In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means \"the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son.\" When a person says \"I am Vipparla-gotra\", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.\n\nAccording to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]\n\nOne who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.\n\nThere exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.\n\n Basically representing the ancestor.\ne.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.\n\nGotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.\n\nSource: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The\\_Seed\\_and\\_the\\_Soil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The_Seed_and_the_Soil)\n\n>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.\n\n\\--- [deleted] [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&q=gotra) Gotra is legalized ostracization.

    "body" : "So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  \n\nSo ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  \n\nThe prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are \"materialistic\" and we are somehow more \"spiritualistic\". I couldn't disagree more.  \n\nRather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called \"spiritual\" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what \"ancient India\" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how \"our Indian culture\" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  \n\nNow don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that \"the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks\" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming \"evil\" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how \"good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is\") while the one's we have *vilified* as the \"ignorant western people\" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  \n\nJust a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  \n\n**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *\"Vimanas\"* (spacecrafts) or the best *\"Brahmastras\"* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP \"FORWARD\" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as \"cool\" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",

    "comment" : " It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  \nHaving a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. \n\nFirst of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. \n\nNobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. \n\nNext, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. \n\nWhere you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. \n\nMoreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. \n\nAnd finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? \n\nEven regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”\n\nYour view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. \n\nI don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. \n\nAgain, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are \"spiritual\"). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:\n\n1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.\n\n2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.\n\n3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.\n\nBtw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  \"Ramayan\" and \"Mahabharata\". I didn’t find what was the specific question though",

Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.\n\nUnderstandably, she does not want to \n\n1. Hurt her family's standings\n2. Cause her family grief and pain\n3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.\n\nI can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. \n\nI want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.\n\nI would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.\n\nThank you very much for reading and commenting.

    "comment" : " Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.\n\nThe sooner you get out, the better it is for you.\n\nI would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. \n\nIf there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.\n\nNow man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.\n\nDon't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.\n\nThe responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. \n\nNo matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  \n\nSo good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  \nYou just run smack into it. \n\nShe’s just like the majority.\n\n(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....\n\nUnlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her?",

My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. \n\n \n\nSo we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack?

    "comment" : " You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.\n\nAlso, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.\n\nFirst, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.\nIndians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.\nThis explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.\n\nIts definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.\n\nThe next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. \n\nQuite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.\n\nHaving said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.\n\nThe real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. \n\nEating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.\n\nRegarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.\n\n  \n\n\nI also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",

I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.\n\nu lost me here.  [deleted]",

    "body" : "Hello /r/india  \n  \nHere are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  \n  \n**[P] - Political**  \n  \nThese are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  \n  \n**[NP] - Non-political**  \n  \nThese are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  \n \nThis is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  \n  \n**[R] - Reddiquette**  \n  \nWhen this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    \n  \nJokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.\n  \nThis can be used for both political and non-political topics.  \n  \n**[ASK] - AskIndia**  \n  \nThese are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  \n  \nIf the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  \n  \n**Science & Technology** \n\nThis flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   \n \nIf Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  \nIf the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  \n\n**Policy & Economy**\n  \nThese flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  \n\n**Business & Finance**  \n\nThese flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  \n  \n**Entertainment** \n\nEntertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  \n  \nThis flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   \n \n**Sports and Food** \n\nSports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  \n\n**AMA**\n  \nAMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  \n  \n**In-Depth**\n\nThis flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.\n\n---  \nPS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.\n  \nRecommendations for new flairs may be made below.

    "body" : "Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. \n\nWould love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...\n\n-------\n\n\"Letters To My Ex\" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.\n\nI think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of \"Notes From The Underground\" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.\n\nAnyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.\n\nThe original book is located here: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex\n\n-----------------------------\n\nThese are my notes:\n\n# On the Book\n\nThis books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.\n\nAs the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.\n\nShe panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. \n\n# January \nThere's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.\n\nThen we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, \"Do you like being ignored?\"  Rolls her eyes!\n\nAnd then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?\n\n# February \nFrom a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  \n\n\nThere is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.\n\n\nYes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.\n\n# March\n\nThis is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.\n\nShe has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.\n\nNeedhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. \n\n# April\nThe first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that \"I don't know\" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.\n\nShe talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, \"Where do we go from here\"? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. \n\nAfter having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.\n\n# May\nMay is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.\n\nThen there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.\n\nThen there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. \n\n# June\nThey have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.\n\nShe is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.\n\nThere is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.\n\n#July \nThe one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!\n\nNeedhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!\n\nThen finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.\n\n# August\nShe has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.\n\nAbhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.\n\nShe felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.\n\n# September\nShe is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.\n\nShe admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.\n\nThe one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.\n\n# October\nShe finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.\n\nTrust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. \n\nEven though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.\n\n# November\nAbhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.\n\nAbhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.\n\nTheir idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.\n\n# December\nShe feels 19 again.\n\nThey have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.\n\nThey are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.\n\n\n",

    "comment" : " >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?\n\nIt might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. \n\n>What is \"standing in the society\", or \"prestige\". Do these things actually take a beating?\n\nThese things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  \n\nMy personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. \n\nAt the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. \nThere will be problems and bitter feelings initially. \nYour first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? \nIf you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. \n\nStand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. \n\nGood luck! \n\nEdit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?\n\nIf arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.\n\n> What is \"standing in the society\", or \"prestige\". Do these things actually take a beating?\n\nThis is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.\n\nIt frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.\n\nSo if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their \"prestige\" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.\n\nJust my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.\n\nHere is why?\n\nIf you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.\n\nDrop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.\n\n\n Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. \n\nBut seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. \n\nScrew your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. \n\nChill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. \n\nTime heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?\n\nYes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.\n\n> What is \"standing in the society\", or \"prestige\". Do these things actually take a beating?\n\nAsshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.",

Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.\n\nAnd we really need some new flairs.  > Rich people don't need subsidies. \n\nSays who?

    "body" : "###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them\n\n#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?\n\nA: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).\n\n#Q: How do I know what flair to use?\n\nA: Use common sense, for example:\n\n* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. \n\n* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. \n\n* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. \n\n* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.\n\n* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.\n\n* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. \n\n* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.\n\n\n#Q: How do I apply the flairs?\n\nA: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\n\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\n\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\n* Policy: [Policy]\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\n\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\n\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \n\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\n\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \n\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \n\n\n\n\nTLDR: Nope! Read it.",

I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.\n*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)\n\n**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  \nto talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party.

I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.\n\n1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.\n2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.\n3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. \n4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.\n5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.\n\nIs it worth it?? Meh....\n\nThis is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.\n\n\n   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.\n\n  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.\n\n",

    "body" : "I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.\n\nAfter that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).\n\nNow, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?\n\nI know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nPS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",

    "comment" : " Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? \n\nIn my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. \n\nSay I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.\n\nWhy complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. \n\nI don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",

For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .\n\nMy wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :\n\n-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. \n\n-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)\n\n-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.\n\n-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.\n\nor\n\n-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.\n\nOn an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. \n\nThats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.\n\nIf we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**\n\nWe hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content.

It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a \"health\" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.\nI want to filter them all out!",

This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.\n* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**\n\nThe basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. \n\n#The Governance Flair\n\n* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. \n* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**\n* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.\n\n\n#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts\n\n* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). \n* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  \n* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.\n* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.\n\n#Unverified Posts\n\n* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].\n\n#Editorialising\n\n* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. \n* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.\n\n#Subreddit promotion via user flairs\n\n* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. \n\n#Mobile Flairs\n* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]\n* Sports: [SP]\n* Technology: [TECH],[TE]\n* Food: [FO], [Food]\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]\n* Politics: [P], [Politics]",

Do you mean a comment?\n2. Do you mean \"non-personal verified\" instead of \"non-personal and verified\"?\n\n> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.\n\nIsn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?\n\nAnd so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are \"non-personal verified\" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.\n\nIn such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!\n\nWhat kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. \n\nIndians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. \n\nThis is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? \n\nWhy isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? \n\nMan, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. \n\nNow, there is no way to differentiate between these two. \n\n1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.\n2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.\n\nSo, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is \"*Flaming the forum*\", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. \n\nJust let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far.",

Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. \n\n* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**\n\n* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**\n\n* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**\n\n* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**\n\n* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. \n\n* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** \n\n**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.\n\n\n* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.\n\nAdditionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. \n\nThanks!\n",

Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? \n\nActually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. \n > * Clarification on Flairs\n\nThis clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.\n\n> * Score hiding\n> * New moderator\n> * Repost removal\n\nAll good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?\n\nWouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.\n\nSo someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.\n \nNope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.\n\n> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.\n\nBullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.\n\n> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.\n\nCan (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.\n\n> Score hiding\n\nThe crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.\n\n> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed\n\nWhat's the problem with them? Bad titling?\n\n> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit\n\nAbsolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.\n\nAdding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.\n\nThe twitter flair is a nice idea BTW.",

    "body" : "An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.\n\n---\n\n**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes\n\n1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:\n * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\n\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:\n * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).\n * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.\n * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions\n\n3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.\n\n4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period \"post-liberalisation\" for each economy:\n * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\nKorea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|\nBGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|\nThailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|\nIndonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|\nMalaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|\nChina|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|\nVietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|\nIndia|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|\n\n5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:\n * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.\n * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.\n\n * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)\n\n * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.\n\n**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",

    "comment" : " There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's \"State of the Economy\" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/qAuBZQNpOV4?t=2m53s Since East Asia was mentioned... bit off-topic but can someone ELI5 how Japan became such a developed country after US completely fucked them over with the Tokyo firebombing and atomic bombings? What the fuck is happening today, back-to-back quality posts.\n\nVery interesting read, yet to complete it but seems like it is gonna be educational.\n\nEdited: a word [Romesh Wadhwani](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/romesh-wadhwani-an-entrepreneur-who-knows-no-higher-calling-115012301147_1.html) a first generation entrepreneur, after his successful attempts, founded the Wadhwani Foundation in 2000 to which he has committed most of his wealth. The foundation’s mission is economic acceleration in emerging economies through initiatives in job creation and skill development.\n\nIndia’s jobs crisis: [Here’s his plan for creating 50 million quality jobs in the next decade](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/indias-jobs-crisis-heres-a-plan-for-creating-50-million-quality-jobs-in-the-next-decade/)\n\nStrategy 1: Appoint a National Jobs Adviser to the Prime Minister in the PMO.\n\nStrategy 2: Create a vast, integrated, national ecosystem for entrepreneurship education, mentoring and support.\n\nStrategy 3: Make it easy for startups.\n\nStrategy 4: Enable growth in existing Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nStrategy 5: Launch a major Startup & Small Business Innovation Initiative (SSBI). \n\nStrategy 6: Create a technology platform that enables startup and SME growth. \n\n\n Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. \n\nThis is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. \n\nSecondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. \n\nThe problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.\n\nIf anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. \n\nI'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**First part**\n\n> Slow but Steady: Western Economies\n\n> Accelerated Growth: East Asia\n\nThis is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. \n\nMost people mistakenly think this is the \"East Asian\" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. \n\nSome people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.\n\nAs far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called \"auxiliary services\". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.\n\nAs for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.\n\nOur largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. \n\nIn footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN.",

More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts\n\nPlease elaborate on this?\n\nAlso, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.\n\nI don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. \n\n>Remove low-effort political self-posts.\n\nYou will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             \nDoes this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          \nI think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            \nSecond, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. \n Ooh.. common account as a mod.. \n\n*interesting*\n\nGovernance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.\n How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.\n\n> Remove low-effort political self-posts.\n\nYes and yes.",

Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. \nFor eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. \n\nThis was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it. \n",

I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.\n\nGetting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.\n\nI'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK. I just saw this on my FB feed about PhD in Germany. Check if you find anything useful.

Furthermore, the rent for the time he has been living should be adjusted from the security deposit. You need to involve a paper trail ASAP. \n\n\nInvolve the police and send him a legal notice if need be. First priority should be to get him out of the house. Police should help out here. But vamilies don't trash rented places. Only vaachalars do.\n\nHope you have taken pictures of the damages. Discriminate against bachelors more. \"Decent guy with 2 kids\" lol I hope you're not in Bengal cause the West Bengal Tenency Act leaves you no room to manoeuvre . Best i suggest is either cut off electricity/water/supplies or go to the local thana. They'll make a call and that sorts out most issues. Or tell any police friends you might have to call and threaten them on your behalf. He doesn't really have any standing . Do not get dragged into court no matter what!!!\n\nGood luck Not an expert on this, but just get a cop in there?

Ok so not great looking and stuff, but I did become significantly better looking after losing weight. I'm told I'm \"cute\". It was a world of a difference with regards to my confidence and peoples perspective of me.\n\nPeople treat me nicer when I'm thinner. I've been on dates with some very pretty girls and all round excellent human beings with interesting backgrounds (models, actresses, chefs, entrepreneurs etc.) Being more attractive than my past self has gotten me more attention and positive interest for the most part. People are also less harsh with their first impression of you. I'm not that good looking that people envy me, so yeah there's that. My friend is great looking.\n\nSo he gets a lot of female attention in general ( nature , you know )\n\nHe was in 2 or 3 platonic relationship ( wow ) \n\nLots of crushes\n\nGets his work done ( from his admirers of course )\n\nBut still he is down to earth and humble. People just stare continuously, it's very very annoying, but I just learnt to ignore and pretend as if nothing's happening.\n\nI feel bad for girls, They have it much much worse. Physical looks of a man don't matter much if it's not matched by confidence and certain badness. It's a mixed bag, you get better treatment from women in general and you end up having a few crazy girls with crushes on you etc. And some guys will absolutely hate you because you will make them feel insecure about their looks.\n\nAlso I have had gay guys do everything from pinch my bum to ask me to do a line of cocaine off their cocks. Nothing against homosexuals but their approaches are by far the creepiest.",

    "comment" : " I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   \n\n\nIn fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   \n\n\nHere's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   \n1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   \n2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say \"I have my routine, I'm doing this.\" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  \n3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   \n\n\nBest of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. \"It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?\"  \n\n\"It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.\"  \n\nWTF.png I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny.

    "flair" : "AskIndia", 
    "comment" : " NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.\n\nSome Cons that aren't always shared:\nExpect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. \n\nOfcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. \n\nBut if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. \n\nMy standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. \n\nProfessional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. \n\nRacism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). \n\nI've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. \n\nHappy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. \n\nYou need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. \n\nFor factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. \n\nHappy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.\n\nEg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. \n\nHis kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.\n\nEg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. \n\nI have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. \n\nThis was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn’t as high paying as the US. But it’s offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It’s a massive pain to adjust to any new country. \n\nEven if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. \n\nBut, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you’ll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. \n\nAustralia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They’ve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] [deleted]",

Hard water can make your hair brittle There are so many reasons for balding:\n\nGenetic\n\nHormonal\n\nHard water\n\nAutoimmune \n\nLast but the best, EVOLUTION (You don't need them to survive so if you're balding and all the other causes are ruled out then consider yourself to be on the forefront of evolution). It's an advantage. Avoid stress, keep your scalp always clean- no dandruff and shit. This worked for me. So, after moving to Bangalore, my hair started turning grey. Moved back home and the grey is almost gone now. Genetics are the main reason for early balding. Your maternal grandfather's hair is a generally a good indicator for your hair health. If he faced balding problems early in his life, there is a good chance of you facing them too.\nStress, diet, haircare and exercise definitely help but if your genetics are the cause of your balding, you're going to face a tough time dealing with it. \nConsult a trichologist who'll give you better insights about it. All I can say mate is go buzz. It's due to genes. But still there may be chances that it's temporary. So don't stress, no gel, no wax and go buzz. See the result overtime.

I use the legs for curry, breasts for something like chicken 65, leftover meat for salad. The bones make a good stock, which can be used with the eggs and leftover meat for Chinese sweet corn chicken soup.\n\nThe trick is to learn how to use every ingredient in many things, as well as how to repurpose leftovers in a different tasting dish. I used these dishes when I was in India, and now that I live in a very expensive country, I use them even more. I just replace Indian veggies with the local cheap ones like broccoli and zucchini.

The conclusion was that no one in India is recycling formally- the technology is too expensive and sending the waste to countries which have this waste recycling facility is not profitable. Hence, almost all of the waste that is collected by these so called \"formal sector\" collection and recycling firms ends up with informal e-waste recyclers which are found in and around Seelampur area in Delhi. \n\nYou could easily give it to the mobile repair shops in your neighborhood who will repair the phone or take the useful parts to use in other mobiles.

I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.\n\nWhat I can remember: \n\n* **Genre**: Hindi pop song\n* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)\n* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A \"hit\" song during the month of CBSE board exam)\n* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. \n* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. \n\nThat's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. \n\n**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.\n\nEdit: Added 2001 to year.",

In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.\n\nOPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. \n\nYou're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.\n\nAlso, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things. Few of my inputs\n\n1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.\n2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.\n3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, if you just want to make a web based product, do as proprietorship. Unless you start earning 5-10 lakhs a year, its useless to get involved in legal stuff.",

You can start from there and slowly build up. Meanwhile, you can keep preparing and practicing programming in your spare time. I can recommend a few online courses as well if you're really interested.\n\nAnd hey, 'my logic is not strong' is not the way to go about this. Spend time, learn, and you'll do more than just fine. All the best. Automation is good field, but don't expect the testing to be a field that companies would be willing to spend on in the near future. Most of them are now hiring full stack engineers who should know to code end to end also are expected to test their own modules. Start working on your java skills, try python too it's easy to pick up if you already understand java. Get a bit onto coding daily, small programs and logic questions like in competitive programming should help you. Don't get disappointed keep on trying you would definitely get better at it.",

I'll address all the recommendations in this thread with my opinion. I spent a lot of time researching bikes this year prior to my own purchase.\n\nDuke 125/200 / MT15 - Do not have comfortable pillion seats. I had to throw them out of my head for that reason alone.\n\nDominar - Meets and maybe even exceeds expectation for the price, but is expensive.\n\nFZ25 - A good machine overall, fits in your budget perfectly.\n\nApache RTR 200 - I own this. If your touring needs are that light, you'll find yourself more than satisfied. It's extremely fun (rev happy), has a comfortable pillion seat and a very satisfying power band.

Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. \n\n7) DTU - Civil\n\n8) DTU - EP Engg Physics\n\n9) DTU - Polymer\n\n10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg\n\n11) DTU - BT Biotechnology\n\nOf late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus.

Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?\n\nQ2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?\n\nQ3.

Equal opportunity doesn’t mean equal outcome. You can create reservations for women in politics but it doesn’t necessarily mean that more women will be inclined to join politics. All you can do is create awareness and leave the choice to them. Why just stop there? Reserve 70-80% seats for backward castes because that's their true population proportion. I don't know how i feel about reservations in general. But if we do implement reservation then why not make it proportional to the actual ratio of men and women? Even if this happens, most seats will be won by women who will be the puppets of their husbands/family, aka Ravri Devi. There needs to be good governance set in place, the probability of an independent woman making it to the top is very less in India unless she's already having a career in politics, which most seats won't have. Let’s also reserve seats based on religion, caste, height, weight, skin tone and length of penis. /s",

There used to be a few services like this in Bangalore (redcooker or something along those lines). \n\nWhy not go for a model like Blue Apron in the US, wherein the user subscribes for pre portioned ingredients with recipes in a way that's user friendly for beginners to make? I love to cook and experiment, but the daily grind ensures that 90% of the time I end up eating out or ordering takeaways.  Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra, just don't make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions. Absolute hygiene is my number 1 priority. Glove, cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible. And dont just say it.Give us proof. Get external agenices to audit the hygiene(if such agencies exist) and also post thorough Hygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable. Put uo youtube videos of kitchen tours. Ok now lets come to nutriton. Obviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an Organic tier. The Organic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically, i.e., without pesticides or hormones etc. And lastly money. You guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails. And Also reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet(cover all the metros to begin with). Thats about it :) Honestly I guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done, but still one can hope, can he not Done. FYI there is an app on Google play store called \"Fofi\" which does the same. Restricted to Chennai though. Like Tinmen?  Where is your would be startup based?  How is this different from eat. fit or half a dozen 'health food' restaurants listed on swiggy right now?\n\nI was witness to the great \"food tech\" boom of 2014, couple of which promised calorie counted, nutrition counted, healthy meals. None of them survived. Why not become an aggregator for homechefs? There are quite a few home run catering services and mom's who cook everyday for their family, if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten, you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery. Homemade meal averages out to Rs 30 per meal (3 rotis, daal and one veg), you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get mom's in to the gig economy.  All the best, OP.",

    "comment" : " I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn’t with him in his last moments. \n\nI had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won’t be there. But when you hear this news you don’t seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It’s gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. \n\nThe initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that’s  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .\n\nAnd then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on. I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. \n\n\nBoth my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.\n\n\nMentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.\n\n\n Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. \n\n\nIt's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents. Please spend everyday with your parents like it would be their last so you don't have any regrets like me. Life is cruel and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Lost my Dad in 2016. I've never been truly happy since then. I always get stressed or mad at even the most silliest thing and it's genuinely ruining my life. Haven't yet managed to think that he's truly gone. :( Depends on what age you lose them, what kind of relation you had, and your own nature.\n\nWhen you get older and lose them, you get over it faster.  If they were suffering from a major illness, you will be relieved that they are gone. [deleted] This thread is full of heart breaking shit man Just horrible. I don't want to say much but it is a very disturbing feeling. I miss the guidance my dad could have given me, but oh well.",

I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.\n\nI have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. \n\nKnowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs.

What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.\n\nI'd like to have full custody of our children.

Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.\n\nI am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.\n\nThere are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

    "comment" : " [deleted] Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            \n\nFirst things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       \n      \nNow, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      \n      \nThis are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      \n      \nIf you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        \n      \nMost importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work.  Document everything. Meticulously. Chat msgs from years back, your paper documents, the money you both spent, everything. As detailed as you can. You never know what can come useful. Don't confront until you have solid evidence.\n\nCustody is something that usually isn't affected by adultery. As in you aren't going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated. Economics and stable environment are the key factors there.\n\nThe simplest way to get access to FB or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they're unlocking and sneak a look. Then ask to make a call or something and use it. There's no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download a virus in the enthusiasm.\n\nStay calm, go take a walk or a long shower. As in chess, when you're position is disadvantaged, it's time to slow down, consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully. Not throw the game in anger. Good luck and keep us posted OP. [removed] I’d recommend you in any emergency case of a 498A/125DV, connect to Shonee Kapoor. This guy literally nailed his own case with a victory (Adultery and post that False 498A. Court had quashed his case and he didn’t have to give any kind of maintenance)\n\nHope you are fine brother. Please collect as much evidence as you can. Phone call recordings, pictures, chats, SMSes, every goddamn thing you have against her.\n\nVery high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those 498A 125DV bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more.\n\nHell, these things literally deter me from getting married in the future. [removed] women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not? Sorry to hear that buddy. I can only wish you good luck... and offer you a beer. Keep your chin up. Take a paternity test. Sincerely Dude consult a family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here. Marriage and divorce are huge thing in India so there is no escaping the family drama. Lesson learnt. Never gonna get married\n",

Stop taking ice cold showers, take hot shower to open up pores and exfoliate, then go cold to close up your pores, moisturize your skin when you get out after you dry off. Drink more water. Wash your face every day and moisturize after. \n\nStop using head and shoulders, it is too alkaline for your skin and the fact is you probably dont have dandruff. Flakes is not dandruff. \n\nHair styling products (salons sell) will not make your hair fall out. Hot water will not make your hair fall out. I dont care what your friend said they are wrong. Turmeric will not make your hair grow more. Henna is bad, I know it's natural, I know your people have used it for 1000s of years. It is bad for your hair. \n\nPomade is your friend, dont be afraid.\n\n-sincerly your friendly American stylist who works with tons of Indian tech guys. Forest Essentials. Olay facewash, a light yellow colored packet, beats others to the dust in terms of skin friendliness and its impact. \n\nGarnier and such brands are so heavy on the skin. Vicco Turmeric, nahi cosmetic. Vicco turmeric cosmetic cream! Half the products mentioned here, I had never heard the brand names before now !  \nI didn't know such things existed !!  \nWhat science, what technology!!!  \nIs this India? Face wash - Avene Cleanance Gel. Costs a bomb but the quantity is huge and value for money.\n\nMoisturiser - ~~Avene~~ Aveeno moisturising lotion. It moisturises really well without making the skin feel oily or greasy.\n\nShampoo - I usually keep changing them after a few months. Started using St. Botanica recently. Too early to give an opinion.\n\nSoap - I use Biotique Almond Oil soap(for lazy days) and keep trying different body washes. Current one is from Palmolive. I like it because it has a scrubby texture. CeraVe was nice but global shipping on Amazon takes time now I just use Cetaphil.  I have long curly hair so most shampoos make my hair super dry and brittle. I switched to biotique sulphate free shampoo and it has made a huge difference but I dont think biotique is like an expensive brand. \n\nIf you feel something is harsh try to read the ingredients list and pick shampoos and soaps that are milder. I cheap out on a lot of stuff especially make up but the only thing I feel I have to spend money on for quality is perfume.  Life Buoy and Dettol products for asli mard. Patanjali if you want skin cancer. Medimix. The hard green one.",

How elders think it's right for them to give unsolicited advice, but when i gave unsolicited advice to them, they get offended. 🤷 Was having my breakfast on the go while waiting for my cab, an elderly lady stops, tells me without anyy greetings, beta zindagi me yaad rakhna kabhi aaj ke baad chaurahe ke beech khade hoke khana mat khana!\nAnd mf just walks away????\n\nHow do i disable these pop up notifications  indians believe a person should get respect on basis of his age not for the person he is. youngesters are expected to respect them and elders are expected to guide youngsters and young one is expected to follow that advice. it's just social expectation from elders to give advice  Superiority complex, mixed with the fact that they have a sense of pride and entitlement, that only god knows where it comes from.\n\nJust had 2 uncles I barely know lecture me about my future career plans, with incorrect information and textbook suggestions and just straight away told me all my future plans are shit and they know better, when they themselves are living a less than mediocre life. Kept staring at my shoes and taunting me how I'll earn the littlest amount of money get lost in brands (the only brand he named was Nike, cause he kept glancing at my shoes) and how after that I'll throw away my money and ruin my life.\n\nSo when you get this \"free ki advice\", just \"smile and nod boys, smile and nod.\" You learn from experiences and they advice you not to take decisions that they took which fucked up their life.",

The cause is not worth the trouble for most people. We don't have Hugh Hefners and Larry Flynts in India. nobody wants to be the known as the guy who stood up for porn.   Because it costs around 2500 to file a petition while VPN is free.  In India, the only sanskaari porn is Kamasutra. Rest is all western propaganda. Because Ekta Kapoor wants you to watch her sleazy shows instead of porn. everybody is waiting for others to start. they will just support. yrah but theyve banned streamable and im too lazy to turn on VPN everytime.  I've experienced something weird. I'm not technically apt to point my finger on it. There were certain obscure porn sites that survived the blanket ban. YOURPORNdotSEXY and the likes.

    "comment" : " I didn't realize the importance of deiting till I got into medschool.\n\nSome tips:\n\n -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.\nSoya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. \n\n\n- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. \n\n\n-  Exercise? \n\n I do warm up first followed by\n\n 500 skips (60fast 40slow)\n\n 70 burpees\n\n 100 push ups \n\nThey can be divided in sets of 3\n\n Abs workout\n\n \n And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)\n\n\n- If you swim after that it's a bonus.\n\nTry reading about High Intensity Interval training. \n\n- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. \n\n\n- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)\n\nHave patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages. \n\n If you just want to lose weight, don't exercise.\nJust create a calorie deficit by eating less and moving more. (Moving includes regular walking and general activity)\n\nIf you want to get fit and build your body, you should take more protein, less carbs and workout more. Doing this will increase your hunger and appetite. So if you stop working out midway, there's a chance of gaining more weight and fat. \n\nSo workout only if you can commit to your plan. Or else just eat less and create a calorie deficit to lose weight.  hit gym regularly. Initially you gain weight. But if you are regular you would tone up. Results will keep you going afterwards. \n\nDon’t diet, eat regular meals. reduce the quantity of carbohydrates (chapathi,rice) increase quantity of the sides (veg,meat) as much. eat seasonal fruits nothing fancy. \n\ndrink water.\n\n\nkeep going!! Was never fat, cycle most days a week, play with a sponge ball in the terrace alone at night because I'm a loser, and that's how I keep my weight in check I walk 10k steps early in the morning in a nearby park. \n\nMy weight has gone from 107.8kg to 96.4 kg in 3 months. My goal right now is to hit 70kg.\n\nI count the calories in my food and ensure that there's a calorie deficit. I eat anything but stay within my calorie limit. For more info go to /r/loseit.  [deleted] **Exercise Routine**\n\nMonday/Wednesday/Friday = bodyweight workouts sourced from the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness\n\nTuesday/Thursday/Saturday = different running workouts, between 3.5 and 10km incorporating sprints, fartlek running, easy runs etc.\n\nI mix in yoga whenever I can remember to do some, and will sub in things like football, rock-climbing/bouldering etc whenever I can get a good group of friends together to go for this stuff.\n\nI also make it a hard rule to always walk to where I'm going if it's a distance of less than 2.5km.\n\n**Diet**\n\nI don't follow a diet at all, beyond basic moderation. Try to stick to unprocessed food, but don't break my head over it. I enjoy cooking and baking and eating out wayyyy too much to let it stress me out; I do make sure I get at least 5 helpings of fruits/veggies a day, and eat a lot less rice. It also helps that I hardly ever drink (once in 6 months), and don't smoke.\n\n**Short and Long-Term Fitness Goals**\n\nShort-Term: maintain regularity (I've been working out using the above template for about 2.5 years now).\n\nLong-Term: Achieve some of the more hardcore calisthenic movements/holds (human flags, iron cross, front lever, etc).\n\n**Motivation**\n\nMy main motivations are to find an outlet for my stress/anxiety, and to maintain some level of control over my health.\n\nI've always had issues with stress and anxiety, to the point of panic attacks, but working out (in conjunction with therapy) has helped that out a *lot* so knowing that helps me stay motivated whenever I feel like slacking off. \n\nExercise to me is just a means to an end, the end being a motivated and healthy body with enough energy to help me get through the rest of my day/deal with my other life goals. So i'm not too fussed about perfecting my physique or going HAM on my diet. Accepting that has helped me be at peace with the fact that I might not be progressing nearly as fast as some of my friends who are more focused/dedicated. Exercise routine is to go to the gym 5 days a week for about 45 mins, each day for a separate body part. I start with legs and get it out of the way because its the most strenuous of the lot. Then I move on to chest, shoulders, back, arms.  \n\n\nShort term fitness goal is actually to feel happy, I go for the dopamine rush more than anything. Long term, I hope to get away from being skinny fat to toning up a bit, nothing too extravagant  \n\n\nDiet: I just don't keep eating till I'm full, and don't eat junk often. That should be more than enough for maintaining decent fitness. People recommending fancy diets have outlandish goals as well, I have no such plans.  \n\n\nAchievement: Clothes fit better, I don't look like a scrawny teenager anymore, and I feel more confident in general. I’ve been following the r/nSuns program the last few months, and have experienced great results. \n\nI’ve also been keeping track of my diet, and overall, feel fitter and stronger by the day.  I mostly just do jogging after waking up and then some hanging exercises on the hanging bar followed by 50 pushups and 50 squats.  Guys Get a mi scale. This gives a wake up call to you. My body fat and Visceral levels are way above. We always have a positive self -image pg our bodies. \n\nThe readings make me more aware of the food I am consuming . \n",

When someone popular takes up an issue (like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist) or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part, they won't try use this momentum to strengthen the movement. They'll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public/personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation.\n\nWhen the Nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country, I noticed so many \"feminist\" activists stay out of it because it was a middle-class protest and because \"where were you\" when previous rapes had happened. They criticized the movement instead of adding to it.\n\nI've noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that I've given up thinking it's limited to just one branch of social activism.

Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.\n2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood.

This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.\n\n    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.\n   \n4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time\n5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.\n6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.\n7.

It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.\n\nIt felt like I paused a day off my normal schedule and experienced something so small yet so beautiful.

This minority is now turning towards hindutva.\n\n AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.\n\n\n\nKerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.\n\n\n\nKarnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. \n\nThing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  \n\nDifferent parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). \n\nAlthough there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. \n\nI have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the \"Hindu\" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for \"Hindutva\" or \"Hinduism\" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a \"non hindu/Muslim party\". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.\n\nThis also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.\n\nHow much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.\nThat explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.\n2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism. \n3. About Hindi: Local RSS functions in the local language but the love for Hindi comes from believing that English is not good for their culture. English education is how one becomes \"westernised\". They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!\n\nThis discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of. Nobody is imposing Hindi on South India, other than the imagination of people who are inherently racist. Believing that someone else is a racist makes the person a racist too.",

So did you mean to ask  \"**Mosquitoes make life a living hell in summer, but where do they disappear to when the weather gets colder?**\" :/ People who are saying that OP has got the situation reversed are wrong. I stay in Bengal and here we see more mosquitoes during Winter, especially in North Bengal. Whereas you don't see much mosquitoes during the summer.  In Mumbai, I feel it's the bad in summer. Okay in Winters. \n\nAdvantage of living in small flats in Mumbai is that you have a lot of control over the air coming in (limited windows) and can easily eliminate mosquitoes. \n\nDownside is, crazy Hugh dengue rates. No Civic authority cares.  Oh, so this is where they migrate to in winter! My dude, you got it backwards. Winters are best because there's almost no mosquitos. \n\nThey come back in the Summers but during Winters you will hardly notice any.  r/titlegore",

To expose the liars.\n\nThings that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).\n\nAlso, people are allowed to have opinions.

She or her parents didn't buy it, her fiancé gifted it to her. **What does he do?** He acted in a flop movie, his dad owns businesses. **What does she do?** She is jobless since her graduation. Her dad is a lawyer I think, (not sure). But I wouldn't say her family income is significantly greater than mine. For all I know, it might be lesser. At every point in time, I worked my ass off. She, not so much. She's got some rich dude now, and suddenly her life has upgraded a million times.\n\nAfter a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.\n\nI know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?",

Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.\n\nYou're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!\n\nAnd he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.\n\nI'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.\n\nI feel you.\n\nI really do.\nAn ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).\n\nI know what you're going through.\n\nI find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. \n\nI made myself. You'll too. \n\nMen want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.\n\nIts all that will ever matter.\n\nI hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.\n\nAnd yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. \n\nAll you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return.

So you have to wait anyway. \n\nWith other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. \n\nNow if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. \n\nCars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.\n\nBut there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.\n\n",

    "body" : "1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.\n\nI think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.\n\n\n* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.\n\n\n* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.\n\n* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.\n\n* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.\n\n* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.\n\n* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.\n",

    "comment" : " I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.\n\nGST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.\nHowever, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.\n\nThe governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.\n\nAs you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.\n\nYes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.\n\n  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. \n\nBut it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]",

Now it seems that she’s not ready for any relationship at all. I understand she’ll need some time but what can I do to make her look at me not just as a friend?  Can’t really ask her to go on a date or something because we both are day scholars and this is a town in india we’re talking about.\n\nPlease give any tips or advice you have.

She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.\n\nI know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows. \n\n\nTake yo chance. CRUSH SITUATIONS  Samhal ja Bhai. Samhal ja.\n\nDon't run the mistakes we runned.",

Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)\n\n I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).\nOnly after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.\n\nSo , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.\n\nHas anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? \n\n",

I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

OK, those things are not so bad, but FFS, stop assuming everyone else's religion/culture/history/food/language is worse than yours & stop trying to expect everyone else to put up with it.\n\n- South Indians think they are more their  religion/culture/history/food/language is the best, they won't impose it on you, because think non-South Indians are not intelligent/cultured enough to appreciate it. i was born and broughtup in Jammu (can't go a lot more north than that) and am currently in Bangalore for an internship, have visited chennai, mumbai and stayed in Goa for a month for another internship last year.\n\nI honestly don't see any difference apart from language, i am not being politically correct but people are exactly the same everywhere, Rajasthan, UP, Punjab, Delhi, etc.\n\nif you understand their language and the different customs there is no difference. btata -> alu or po-tae-too -> po-taa-too As a northie, southies for me are:\n\n1) Mostly Polite.\n\n2) Less likely to take pride in being an ass.\n\n3) Peculiar/curious habits regarding food. Like having rice for breakfast. is impossible for me. \n\n4) Disgusting porn. Most Indian porn is shit anyway.\n\n\n\nI haven't lived in any southern state and impression is from various people I've met till now.\n\n What are people from Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam? North Indians or south Indians? My North-South experience is mostly shaped by me being a NRI Guju who had South Indian roommates and friends at my American university\n\n- South Indians are very humble and polite. Even the Southie party types are somehow modest about it, lol. I knew of exactly one douchebag Southie in college. All the pompous irresponsible d-bags were North Indian.\n- At the same time, certain South Indians can be extremely arrogant about their perceived superiority. This was the case with my main roommate, A Tamilian, who considered everything outside the very South to be \"North India\". He thought North Indians were scum for their eagerness to be \"white\". He thought of North Indians as white people basically while South Indians are the true Indians who came directly from Africa. He hated North Indians for their lighter skin, big noses and considered South Indians' darkness to be a virtue.\n- I actually agree with some of those thoughts. I think North India is inferior in many respects (education, morality, proportional advances made for India). I do think North Indians are excessively obsessed with being seen as modern by the West. *Grabs popcorn* Northeast feels neglected again.  Disconnect happens when one is too stringent with their own customs and language. \n\nIf you are making effort to learn about each other, one does not see disconnect just the varying of degrees/levels of customs. \n\nI'm from the east... Have friends from J&K to Kanyakumari and Arunachal Pradesh to Gujarat. Few are lurking here right now.\n\nSorry about your bad experience in Chennai the language barrier does bring in some ugly side of the city but trust me it is in general a lovely place if you discount the heat. Basic Tamil (Tamizl) is easy to pick up. get that under your belt and you will see the difference.\n\nBangalore has always been multicultural. It was a retirement destination of Army guys. Damn cultured though deteriorating now. Tempers are down because of the weather unlike Chennai :)\n\nLove both the places for different reasons.   Bring on the hate Where is /u/maderchodlungibaaz?",

I don't do affiliate marketing, but I get my payments in USD to my bank account, it's a similar situation. You definitely have to pay income tax. I don't know about GST sorry.\n\nEdit: Likely scenario is that if you sell via Amazon India, then Amazon will handle GST for you. If you sell via Amazon International then may be GST does not apply. Best to check with a CA - though most of them are as of now confused and don't have clarity on it either. I am in the exact same position as yours.. I haven't sorted the GST thing... How do you do your income tax returns.  How did you become an affiliate? Check with a CA dont pay tax directly and ask for refund. CA knows this better.

After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\n\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\n\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\n\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\n\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\n\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\n\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\n\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\n\nLet's begin with the Mughals\n\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\n\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\n\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\n\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\n\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\n\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\n\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\n\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\n\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\n\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\n\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\n\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\n\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\n\nIndia begins to re-industrize\n\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\n\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\n\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\n\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\n\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\n\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\n\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\n\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\n\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\n\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\n\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\n\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\n\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\n\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\n\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\n\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\n\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\n\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\n\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\n\nIndia after the Reforms\n\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\n\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\n\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\n\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\n\nSome lessons\n\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\n\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\n\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\n\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\n\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\n\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\n\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\n\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\n\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\n\nDoes culture matter?\n\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\n\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\n\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\n\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\n\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\n\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\n\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\n\n\n",

    "comment" : " Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an \"evil\" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  \n\nIMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding \"India\" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.\n\nYes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a \"Indian\" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. \n\nThe drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the \"gifts\" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.\n\nA book came out last year called \"Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830\" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. \n\nHe makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. \n >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. \n\nI'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice \"peaceful.\" Have read the whole thing.\nThe Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.\n\nTaking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.\n\nThis they did by creating:\nLow literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)\n\nUnstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.\n\nPersonally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch.",

They used satire in a smart way to draw attention to a serious issue which got neglected by the media. Divert faking news to /r/bakchodi  I find the 'Political' tag fairly apt for Faking News these days. It's become a propaganda site. Instead of \"humor\", I'd suggest \"satire\" flair if it's too necessary. Under humor flair, shitty Whatsapp political images about \"pappu, feku and bhagoda\" will get posted and just degrade the sub. I was just going to post this. It should be a \"satire\" flair.

I think that's a fair suggestion. \n\nThose posts certainly don't add anything substantial to a discussion - they are mostly attacks on political parties which are passed off as sarcasm. If mods are removing low-effort political posts (personal twitter / images) I feel these should go the same route.  Random question. Are there any faking news articles that poke fun at the Modi government?",

It is a dangerous concept that has become the emotional basis for the state of the Ummah today and one, which visibly fortifies the division among those who profess to believe in the same ideology. Furthermore, the Muslims identify themselves as Turkish, Arab, African and Pakistani. If this is not enough, Muslims are further sub-divided within each country or continent. For example, in Pakistan people are classed as Punjabis, Sindhis, Balauchis and Pathans. This fragmentation continues to gain momentum amongst the Muslims. \n\n Certainly there would be people who would accept that considering we have likes of Indian mujahideen, SIMI functional in india. \n\nMuslim religion is made such that it is intolerant of all other religions and all other systems, for obvious reasons .\nA muslim who wants to stay muslim will have to accept caliphate because he cannot be disloyal to his religion.\n\nThis certainly is an important issue and any such attempt need to be squashed.

    "comment" : " > The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s constitution explicitly states that it will stay clear of politics. **The constitution itself was written, in 1949, because Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel would have it no other way**.\n\n> ... The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.\n\n> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.\n\n> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”\n\n> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don’t remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that’s grounds for dismissing the leadership? So, complain to Sardar Patel? ;)\n\nOathBreakers.",

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.\n\n> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...\n> \n> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.\n> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..\n> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.\n> \n> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....\n> \n> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.\n> \n> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....\n> \n> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....\n> \n> I am sorry for those who feel offended by my answer....but am ready to face any debate who could challenge my answer.....\n> \n> Mukesh Sahu.\n> Assistant Professor (ECE Deptt)\n> H.O.D.

    "comment" : " You cannot do anything dude.. Thats the way copies are checked all over India. Trust me. Happens here to @ University of Madras and Anna University..\nAnna University is the worst of the lot :(\n\nI have seen my friends getting A/S Grade after applying for revaluation..in the end they pay 750rs per paper(Original exam fese) + 700rs(Revaluation fess) Any inside stories from VTU? Eh? isn't this common knowledge? \n\nin AP, Telangana both 10th,11th and 12th papers are corrected by lecturers coming from schools and other districts and they are paid according to number of answer scripts they check. like 8rs per paper. so, to make money, they end up rushing. \n\neven OU and jntu engineering papers are corrected this way. \n\nalso, since they come from other districts, if you give latest relevant examples on your answers, theyll cut marks since that example is different from your text book Subjective exams in India , ah the good old days In my Medical Sciences University, we enacted wide ranging examination reforms. \nWe tried to make all our examinations objective (see: OSCE / OSPE ) However, the Medical Council of India had mandated essay and short answer type questions and we could only impose objectivised examinations for the formative stage. \n\nFor summative however, we did this:\n\nOne Evaluator will evaluate ONE answer for all the students who appeared in the exam. His bias will be distributed equally to all the students. Also, we do post-examination analysis to see if the answermarks form a bell curve. Camel humps and shifts to right and left will make us blacklist the examiner. \n\nIn post graduate exams, the same answersheet is evaluated independently by three examiners, blinded to other's marks. If the discrepancy between the three is greater than 25%, a fourth examiner is bought in and the average of all the four is taken as marks awarded.\n\nIt is possible to study the problem and introduce corrective steps, but most of our universities are archaic and very slow to change anything.  It happened to me in my first semester at College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai.   \nThe lecturer was miffed with our batch and decided to fail random students.   \nShe awarded F for first, middle and last 6 of students with even roll numbers.   \n  \nI fell in one of those even roll number and failed, despite having scored S grade in all my internals, and it was my favourite paper.   \nFailing first time academically was hard on me, and I was crying in my lecture hall for the whole day (cringe).   \nI had to apply for reevaluation to clear it.   \n   \nThat episode was a turning point in my student life, and went on to score few more arrears in the following semesters, and didn't give a flying fuck.   \n  \n   \nOur rating systems are a joke. Being an Ex - IPU student.... I'm not even surprised.  Happened to me in 12th Board.\n\nUsed to always score 90+ in maths, was expecting atlesst 95. Got 40!\n\nApplied for revaluation. Nothing happened. ",

    "comment" : " I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?\n\nFrom my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.\n\nThe most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?\n\nMy background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.\n\nThen I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking \"why?\" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.\n\nThis is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that. But you are the one who has to live your entire life on those decisions. Why not make an informed, well-thought one? Understand the future prospects of those professions, what you want with your life, and which one aligns the most closely with your ambition and desires. Best of luck, OP.",

I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:\n\n1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. \n\n2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?\n\n3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?\n\n4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?\n\n5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?\n\n6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision?

In that chain of arguments there is a dual process. One is that high growth means more jobs. So if the poor have more jobs, they will have more income. Two, if there’s growth, the economy expands and taxes go up.\n\n> *  With that money, you can fund anti-poverty programmes. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument. But it doesn’t always work. For instance, even in the highest growth period in India, **say between 2003-08**, most of the evidence shows that employment didn’t grow much.\n\nHere is [Livemint's Claim Check](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html) on the topic:\n\n>Claim: The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government.\n\n> Who: Narendra Modi.\n\n> Where: At a rally in Rohini, Delhi.\n\n> Check: Modi is right. Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, there were 60.7 million new jobs that were created as against 2.76 million new jobs between 2004-05 to 2009-10.\n\n> Source: Institute of Applied Manpower Research, Planning Commission.\n\nThis illustrates how \"growth\" and \"development\" are not isolated and dead unlively numbers but on-the-ground impacts. How in the relatively low growth 5y period of NDA rule, they were able to add fucking 57 MILLION more jobs than the UPA in a *high* growth 5y period!

This guy hacked his way into politics. Very soon he will get a ticket from the party he follows. This is a very troubling precedent. Back in 2010 I was driving a cab in Melbourne, I picked up an Indian passenger who was drunk and he refused to go through a Hungry Jacks (what they call Burger King in Australia) drive through because he said Muslims work in this one. He instead asked to take a detour through an adjacent suburb to goto another Hungry Jacks outlet, where he was served by an Indian fella.\n\nOn top of that he was rude and Ill mannered, then while we were on the freeway heading to the final destination, he told me \"abhi main tere ko maarne wala hu\", means I am about to hit you.\n\nI pulled up in the emergency lane and pressed the alarm underneath the dash,  operator rang me immediately, I informed them I have a  racist customer who also threatened physical assault, I am dropping him off in the middle of the freeway with nearest exit being 4  kms either way, so they should ring the cops as i wont be responsible if he gets hit by another vehicle on the freeway but I can't take him due to safety concerns. What an idiot Pleases me personally but Freedom of speech should be sacrosanct. Please shame him but there is no need for the State or law to get involved in this. My mother is a vegetarian and she doesn't let us touch her food utensils when we consume non vegetarian food.  I narrated her this news today and asked her opinion. I actually wanted to understand the other side of it. \n\nShe said my religion should be at my own expense. If I am that particular then I won't even order food from outside. Pointless debate people are doing on the twitter and WhatsApp forwards. \nbut I agree with Shukla ji on one thing, Zomato ka customer care and cancellation is worst lol. Sometime back I ordered and payment option I kept cod. I had to add an item and called restaurant folks if they can cancel, they didn't know process. So I cancelled from my end. Nothing prompted at that time. Now when I order next time, they add that cancelled amount to new orders. \nAbhi switched to swiggy/uber. Swiggy I feel have best UI.",

The central government aspect (offices, recruitment process) has been a point of contention for sometime now. What were they doing when his sister was a cabinet minister? Oh right, 2G \n\nKarunanidhi said Maran knew Hindi, and that's why he was being made a cabinet minister even though he was new to politics. \n\nMeanwhile he is also supporting 100% Urdu schools in TN for capturing the Muslim vote.\n\nThis family has never been interested in Tamil, except as a low cost political tool. If you read his father's commentaries of Tamil texts like Thirukkural you'll see how half baked it is. Bad interpretations and out right lying to hide the Hindu origins of the Thirukkural. It seems that the demand be that Tamil be given equal importance in central govt offices that are IN tamil nadu.. That seems fair.. I have seen many instances where the staff and the locals could not effectively communicate because they spoke only hindi or english.. \n\nIt would be great if the staff also spoke Telugu if they are operating in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana.. It's called pandering people If Hindi is an official language, why not Tamil? Central govt?? Then you gotta put bengali before that. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers_in_India\n\nState govt? Do whatever you want.

So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?\n\nA fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \\~3Tn economy is damn huge! \n\nConsidering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.\n\nI'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",

    "comment" : " Startup definition in India is at nascent stage , valley philosophy needn't apply to village. What exists is convoluted definition where we try to apply philosophies of established startup environments like San Fransisco, London etc. here.\n\nA startup in India has more business values to gain from street side vendor than what is projected on Tech Crunch, so let's be conservative when it comes to using the term 'Startup' and call what it is in India - A 'Business' like any another.\n\nI started my company in 2014, when 'Startup' was not officially recognised in India by govt. in any form from a former village in a Tier 2 city. We built lifestyle products using funds from providing services to niche customers in VSAT space (Internet via satellite), Biometrics etc.\n\nAfter a series of dud products, we saw our success with chat-app network dating product which was eventually accelerated by Facebook. Unfortunately,  the success didn't last long as I had to close my company this year because of my health issues (I was the single founder).\n\nThough the reason for closing my company (startup?) was entirely mine, there were several areas in which I could have seen success much earlier only if I had started my company in a better ecosystem. Because I built international products, I had to compete with startups from better ecosystems like SF, Singapore, Tel Aviv etc. thereby in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe areas of improvement for the startup ecosystem in India are plenty both from government and in the attitude of the entrepreneurs . I'm now utilising my experience to help other [entrepreneurs](https://hitstartup.com) and occasionally respond to startup related comments here. A lot of gov initiatives are focused towards startups, accessing them is tough though. I my experience India has one of the most supportive startup ecosystems. What exact support are you looking for? If you want office space for a few of you use mine in Bangalore. Would be happy to help in any other way. Just reach out. Is there a subreddit for Indian startups? If not we should start one. Good idea. There are a few slack threads. Subreddit should help I wasn't expecting such response for this thread & I still think there's some scope for improving the startup culture in India. First thing first is to develop an environment to make open discussion, feedback, advices, etc. What's better than our own r/india, so I think I'll start out small with fortnightly discussion threads or twice a month and see how much traction does it create. We can accordingly either move over to a seperate subreddit altogether or come up with Discourse forum or something alike.\n\nAnyway massive thanks to u/hitstartup and u/jdontherocks for your valuable inputs. Especially u/hitstartup, I've read your blog, the satirical comic strips you created are quite humorous and is pretty relatable. I remember this one time when I attended a startup meet and the people there were pretty awkward & boring, barely speaking anything interesting about their products but were quick to hand out their business cards. Besides, I hope you recover quick from your surgery and get back to actions since some of us can use your experience and knowledge in the field to hone our skills.\n\nLooking forward to having more conversations such as this. Thank you all. Indians do much much more 'Startups' than you think. It's just that most of these won't fit your typical VC Fuelled Silicon Valley model of \"Go Big or Go Home\" definition of startup. \n\nIn IT it has been quite easy to create a multi-million dollar outsourcing company in few years time with very high probability of success whereas doing a typical silicon valley like startup mostly ends up nowhere. Still there are a lot of product companies who have made sustainable business in internet space and went to IPO. Naukri, Shaadi, Justdial, Redbus, MMT etc. Others like Paytm, Zomato, BookMyShow, Practo etc are doing fine too.\n\nAnd the most successful cash-rich startup has been Jio. It has all the qualities of a silicon valley startup with deep pockets - like Uber, and has disrupted the market just like uber did.",

    "comment" : " >There are currently 84 seats for scheduled tribes and 47 seats for scheduled castes, which amounts to a total of 131 seats, a significant number to make their voices heard and be a part of mainstream politics.\n\nThose reserved seats change location (afaik) and aren't concentrated in a region but spread over the country. \n\nWith reserved seats, when a person from reserved seat would have won, s/he wouldn't have faced the strongest candidate from that area, and hence would likely not gain power later when it isn't reserved. \n\nThis means which ever SC/ST MPs win they likely aren't first choice of the people and unlikely to repeat which means they lack power which you expect from 131 seats. More over MPs from these seats are from different parties, leading to them having different agendas. \n\nMayawati for example is from SC. And, BSP is a party that campaigns on SC/ST/OBC agenda, but mostly serves its leaders. Scheduled tribes are almost always from states with marginal political impact. In case of SC MPs they do come from large states. But again the largest of these block come from UP. And you would notice the most visible SC MPs come from UP as well. Also the mainstream parties either intentionally or unintentionally sideline the SC/ST MPs. Case in point Jual Oram. He was the only MP from BJP from Odisha. Now Smriti Irani/Dharmendra Pradhan  were inducted into cabinet in high visibility ministries where as Jual Oram got relatively obscure Ministry (SC&ST affairs). Congress was even worse. In 2009 Congress won 6 seats from Odisha in 2009. 3 Of those were from ST/SC seats. None were in the council of ministers. This was answered by Ambedkar himself.\n\nThere is joint electorate with reservation. However the population of SC (and ST) is too low to ensure majority.\n\nSo the majority community would field a candidate who belongs to SC (and ST), but would actually represent the interests of the majority community.\n\nErgo, not benefit the SC (and ST).\n\n**Francesca R. Jensenius (2017). Social Justice through Inclusion** confirms this.\n1.\tCondition of SC in reserved constituency is not better than non reserved constituency\n2.\toverall development of reserved constituency is not worse off then non reserved constituency\n3.\thas transferred the power to leaders of SC(and ST) community.\n\nThus Ambedkar was right in asking for separate electorates. It’s because these leaders are fielded primarily by political parties because there is constitutional requirement to field such candidates. Take that away, and I can promise you that representation would go down significantly. Just look at muslim representation in legislatures. Even parties like BSP don’t field SC candidates from unreserved seats because they know that they will not get votes.\n\nMost mainstream political parties are also not interested in development of Dalit political leadership. All they want is Congress Dalit leader or BJP Dalit leader or [insert your party] Dalit leader. If these leaders move away from the party line on Dalit issues then they will face the music.\n\nAnother issue is that the mainstream media is dominated by upper classes and they will invite Dalit figures only to speak on Dalit issues. For everything else, the upper classes will be the voice. Look at TV debates in UP, you will find that all spokesmen and panelists tend to be disproportionately Brahmins or Thakurs as if other communities simply don’t have anyone to speak on topics of national and local importance. It’s true that some of these are down to structural makeup of society but there is no serious attempt either to change it. It is because of the faulty design of SC/ST elections in our country. Which Ambedkar realized soon after independence. \n\nIn the system of reserved seats and not separate electorates... \nLet us consider a example. \nThere is a staunch dalit party who actively rails against the sawarnas and genuinely wish to work for dalits. Their candidate for the reserved seat is Mr. Dalit. He is extremely popular among the dalits of that area. \n\nThen there is a centrist or right wing party who don't have much fucks to give about dalits. They find a dalit ready to sell his soul for getting elected or for money so they get Mr. Sold to stand on the reserved seat. Mr. Sold is unpopular among dalits of the area. \n\nThe seat has 30% dalit population. When elections comes, all those 30% vote for Mr. Dalit. \nBut the rest who are not very happy about this dalit party will vote for Mr. Sold. He will win by a great margin. \n\nAnd hence will come in Parliament a dalit who is not going to speak a word about dalit issues. \n\nAmbedkar... Grand leader Ambedkar stood for two LS elections and lost both. In the second one, he came third. :)\n\nIt is only then that he realized that reserved seats are meaningless. This is why Ambedkar wanted separate electorate for SC/ST. That's why \"poona act\" which he agreed to when Gandhi went on hunger strike is considered worse thing for dalits. Read Kashi Ram's \"chamach yug\" of it's translation in your language to understand it more. [deleted] Unke pas govt jobs main reservation h toh wo wo le lete h",

They already cancelled my scheduled flight and put me on another one. Hoping against hope that it does not get cancelled. I really don't want to pay an extra 30K for another flight. Book your next tickets. Chances are immensely high that your flight is going to be cancelled and you'll get a full refund. If you wait for the confirmation and then book your alternative flights, you're going to have to pay through your nose. Be willing to forgo some money. My girlfriend had a flight at the end of the month. They emailed her saying the flight is cancelled. We then went to the airport to the jet office and got the refund processed.

I tracked the caste background of the 40 CRPF jawans whose deaths were confirmed immediately after the attack. While the names of a few jawans revealed their respective caste identities, for those bearing caste-neutral last names, I spoke with their family members on telephone numbers registered with the CRPF. I also determined the caste identities through conversations with journalists who covered the jawans’s cremation; local politicians; social activists; sociologists; and by scanning media reports.\n\n>The 40 jawans were primarily from lower-caste communities. In all, they comprised 19 jawans from Other Backward Classes (or backward castes), seven from Scheduled Castes, five from Scheduled Tribes, four from upper-caste backgrounds, one high-caste Bengali, three Jat Sikhs, and one Muslim. So, only five out of the 40 jawans, or 12.5 percent, came from Hindu upper-caste backgrounds. This figure bears out a truism starkly visible in India at present—the Hindutva nationalism of the urban middle-class, largely spearheaded by right-wing groups, conveniently exploits the sacrifices of the downtrodden. I am excited that I am going to watch Endgame this weekend. Wouldn't be so excited had the events in the movie affected me personally. So what though?

I stayed in my dorm, got high and gamed all year I do a lot of events so like my attendance was kinda cut back FY of college. We get like 1hr breaks before our post noon lectures start so I’d go out drinking to places I’d wanted to try out and time would pass by like nobody’s business ya. Frequently missed those slots post noon. Also, for events sometimes I’d have meetings and such scheduled in the middle of the day which were too important to miss so that as well. Had to attend conferences and such too yada yada yada. \n\nDidn’t smoke uP during college though lol. Luckily, found the error in my ways and scheduled everything I did post college/delegated midday tasks to someone else. My college cuts you out, won’t let you take exams if you don’t meet the 80% criteria eh.

Probably when an MP would have to get operated on by a non-meritous SC / ST surgeon they would know.\n\nThey should keep STEM merit based and away from reservation. How much empowerment does one need before feeling empowered? Apparently, not even after having a job.\n\nI fail to see the rationale behind this. When in opposition, these sanghis would have called such a move \"appeasement\". I guess party with a difference is only different in terms of having a forked tongue.\n\nI'm not even getting into merits of reservations in promotions- if designed properly, those would help counter the inherent bias within the system. However, knowing how spectacularly\"the most capable administrator in india\" botched gst implementation, by passing a law without thinking (one country, one tax, only in name), and implementing it without being prepared, i can bet that there hasn't been any thought beyond, \"how can we split the dalit vote?\" Yeah fuck that.  Fine as long as its clerical work.  But I don't want my chief of surgery to be an average student. Where merit matters,  relaxation of criteria shouldn't be there. It's not going to be a big problem if you promote a 95% percent scoring SC/ST guy over a 97% general,  but not very good for general public when a general guy with all India rank 20,000 doesn't get admission to a govt medical college but a scst student who didn't even qualify for the admission has been admitted because there weren't any candidates from that caste who scored more than 50th percentile. \n\n  fuck logic and merit ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**SC, ST quota in promotion: Narendra Modi government takes this big decision** \n\n ______ \nThe move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.\n(PTI)\n\nThe Centre today asked all its departments and the state governments to\nimplement reservation in promotion for employees belonging to Scheduled Caste\n(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The move comes following a recent\nverdict by the Supreme Court in this regard. The Personnel Ministry, in an\norder, said, “The cadre controlling authorities of Central government\nministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in\naccordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” Every promotion order\nmust clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to\nfurther orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to\nthe order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state\ngovernments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.\n\nThe personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category\nemployees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.\nThe apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation\nin promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in “accordance\nwith law”.\n\nThe top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process\nof promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various\nhigh courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar\nmatter in 2015. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in\naccordance with law,” a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel\nand Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,\nrepresenting the Centre.\n\nDuring the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in\npromotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement\nin M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that\ncreamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992\nIndra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal\nCommission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,\nwhich dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.\n\nOn November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to\nconsider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be\nre-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney\ncase in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to\ncontinue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.\n\nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual\nFunds, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers,\nTop Losers &amp; Best Equity Funds.

Now that's where you made a mistake, had you chosen one of many other states I would have believed you, but had something like this really happened in Rajasthan, the SDM would have been wiped off the face of Earth What was the duty?

    "body" : "Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month\n\nA little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.\n\nSo I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.\n\nI checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.\n\nSo within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:\n\n1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is \"highly interested\" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.\n\n\n2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - \"hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?\" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. \n\n\n3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, \"I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number\". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- \"ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste\". Never heard back from her.\n\n\nThere are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. \n\nNow I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",

I thought caste no longer existed in cities /s\n\nFunny how the OBC girl was open-minded... for the castes above her.  OP, just invite me to your wedding, that's all I care about.\n\nPS: I'm from okayish caste, not too high, not too low. Any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them.  So \"open minded\" is my caste plus caste considered above mine. Matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad. \n\njust a thought, you are still 27 why hurry?  There was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change.  This is the same.  Unfortunately Indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties. There will be the same BS except it's online. \n\nTake some time out and start dating.

    "comment" : " Very well made site. Whoever made this, keep it updated. The statistics on crime rates against SCs and STs are completely false and have been debunked. Here's a piece where two professors, Dunkin Jalki and Sufiya Pathan, are debunking the stats on how crime against SCs supposedly increased by 746%.\n\nRead the entire piece for all the details.\n\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/have-crimes-against-scs-and-sts-increased-of-late-here-are-the-facts/1147315/\n\n> A website named Indiaspend, which calls itself the “country’s first data journalism initiative”, and aspires to be the “agency of record when it comes to data and facts” recently ran a sensational cover story about the rise in crime rates against Dalits in India. It claimed that its analysis of data from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) indicated a sharp rise in crimes against Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and that the crime rates against the communities had jumped eight times (746%) and 12 times (1,160%) respectively in the past decade.\n\n> ...\n\n> And then Indiaspend realised it had bungled? The authors of the article, in their enthusiasm to play up caste atrocities, had compared entities with different denominators to make the claim. They regretted their error, attributing it to the change in NCRB’s methodology. What they did not mention in their regret message though was that they had misquoted the report. They changed a few things in the article, importantly the claim of 746% increase in crime rates against Scheduled Castes was changed to 25% increase and 1,160% increase in crime rates against Scheduled Tribes was changed to a 9% decrease after their new calculations. But many errors were left as they were and a new title was chosen, cherry-picking another number so that the original narrative of a steep rise in caste atrocities remained intact and the article was salvaged.\n\n> ...\n\n>  For example, in the time period that we are told the crime rate against Scheduled Castes increased by 25% (was 746%), the rate of overall crimes as reported under Indian Penal Code (IPC) increased by more than 39% and the rate of violent crimes against all Indians went up by more than 45%. So, if the crime rates against Scheduled Castes have increased at a lesser rate as compared to the overall increase in crime rates, is it justified to talk of a rise in crime rates against SCs?\n\n> ...\n\n> If we were to consider the rate of all the violent crimes together we get the values of crime rates as 39.46, 10.9 and 4.36 for the overall population, SCs and STs respectively. The crime rates imply that both SCs and STs face at least several times lesser violent crimes than the average of 39.46 for the overall population. So, people belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in India, the data tells us, face lesser violence and have a far lesser chance of being a victim of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and kidnapping than others. I think while the site is a good attempt, it's also  biased in it's tone. \n\nWould have preferred a neutral tone and leave it to the reader to conclude. Also, there are no successes at all?\n\n And still 71% Indians are gonna vote him to power according to ' MEGA TIMES GROUP' poll. Fact based analysis of Modi govt's achievements in four years. Lol the last time.\n\n\"[Modireportcard.com](https://Modireportcard.com). Made in India\" There must be some progress made in the last 4 years . It would add more credibility to this report if you add some progresses made as well , ofcourse comparing that with the work of the previous govt.\n I was fuming with rage as I was going through the content, thinking how this person has still got followers.\n\nInteresting thing, american politics is also going through an almost similar phase (see [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8mfhry/comment/dznj39u?context=3) comment).\n\n  \n This is pretty one sided. For one, doesn't talk about urbanization or electrification. For this kind of analysis to be accepted by ppl you need to also discuss the positives of which there certainly are some. \n\nAlso, If i were to throw absurd stats to prove a very unrelated  point i would soon be out of a job. For ex- How is militry casualty rate an indication of terrorism funding? Plz don't promote data butchery. \n\n I am not a supporter of BJP. I am a data guy.  The website doesnt mention any positive steps in the past four years. Did the governement literally did nothing good? Even the worst governments of the country have been credited with some good developments. Whoever made this, great job man.",

What about punishments for BJP members who support the perpetrators? a tit for a tit makes the whole world booby. - mahatma gandhi.  Ya right. \n\nIf a mob lynches a person, who will you give the death penalty too? The entire mob?\n\nCan we have this law with retrospective effect so we can deal with 1984, 2002 and various other mobs once and for all? I suppose a side benefit would be a substantial reduction in population too. Death for raping, death for lynching. These laws never work.\n\nThe best measure is not a new law, but **quick** justice on the original law.\n\nMeasures like no easy bail after first conviction will go a long way.\n\n [deleted]",

I'm confused whether I should try out antidepressants without prescription or not? I'm doing my CBT through a book called \"feeling good\" but I read it's best to take drugs as well.

Unwittingly, the ruling party vindicated the Opposition charge that the Modi government is anti-Dalit.**\n\n> The problem cropped up when Nishad insisted on a vote. **Normally, such non-official Bills and Resolutions are withdrawn by the Member who moves them.** But on this occasion,  the Samajwadi Member insisted that it should be put to the vote.\n\n> Deputy Chairman Harivansh proceeded to ask for a voice vote - and, as expected, declared that it had been ‘negatived’.\n\n> **However, Nishad and some others demanded a ‘Division’, which means actual voting that is recorded and tallied.** The Deputy Chairman went right ahead and ordered the “lobbies to be cleared” and set the voting process rolling.\n\n> There were howls of protest from the Treasury benches. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad jumped to his feet and raised objections ... Social Justice Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot joined his Law Minister in saying that only Bills are put to the vote and not Resolutions.\n\n> It was too late. Acting on the advice of the Secretary-General, the Deputy Chairman ruled that since he had already ordered the lobbies to be cleared, the  voting process had effectively been started and could not be stopped.\n\n> There was no way out. Electronic voting took place. The result was 32 in favour of the Resolution and 66 against.  **The Private Member’s Resolution had been defeated – but there were red faces on the Treasury benches for having voted against ensuring equal treatment of Scheduled Caste citizens in all the States of the country and bringing\nabout a uniform reservation system free of discrimination.**\n\n> What the Resolution sought was to provide standard and uniform norms to end discrimination. **Basically, the need is to ensure that persons belonging to SC/ST category in one State should be treated as belonging to that SC/ST category all over the country.**\n\n> **All political parties across the ideological spectrum agree to this. But the BJP voted against it on the floor of the Rajya Sabha** - much to the delight of the Opposition parties.\n\n What was the resolution? Is there a full text available? I am now wondering is Congress (though Arrogant and Corrupt) a better devil then BJP (Hindutva Terrorist, Against Muslims and Dalit equality) ,  >What the Resolution sought was to provide standard and uniform norms to end discrimination.  This can be done only by amending Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution to include the homonymous and synonymous sub-castes of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in accordance with the castes registered State-wise in the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 in all the states.\n\nMaking or changing law will not get rid of the discrimination..

If you are investing for long term, never track progress daily and it will never be accurate of your final returns. Log in every month or so if you are anxious. I typically check every six months of how my portfolio is doing and rebalance once a year if required. The long term investment is a game of patience.\n\nScripbox is okay and sells regular funds. I and /r/IndiaInvestments would normally recommend a direct fund option but as you are new and so anxious on a small dip, I would recommend to stick with Scripbox as they (apparently) do rebalancing for you and tax optimized exit load. I have seen their recommended funds and they are good. Keep doing the investments. Also /r/IndiaInvestments  The market is down OP.  Frequent /r/IndiaInvestments, really helpful community. Started my MF investments by taking guidance from them.\n\nSince most of the comments have already answered your question. Let me share an interesting point from an [article](https://eightytwentyinvestor.com/2018/03/11/dude-shall-i-cut-my-equity-exposure/) i got from that sub recently.\n\n> A high equity allocation also comes with the caveat that you must be mentally prepared for a 50% correction once in 5-7 years, 25-30% correction once every 3 years and 10% correction every year (all these are rough estimates and not cast in stone)\n\nThat's how markets work, stick for the long haul (10+ years) and you'll reap it's benefits! You have essentially invested when the market was at all time peak and started comparing when markets started slow downward slide in last month or so. Even the best funds show negative results for short span of time of 3 months including a peak and a dip. \n\nKeep on investing small amounts and check only over long periods of time. At least 3 or 6 months to readjust your SIP's yearly. are you stupid op? the entire market has gone down in the last 3 months. what does that have to with scripbox? You chose to invest at a wrong time. You probably invested at the top. People have been searching for a fund which can beat the market but nah no one can escape the markets reality, unless you have contacts with warren buffet, george soros or Jim simons..and copy their portfolio..\n>I subscribed to Scripbox 3 months ago\n\nIndian market has been doing shit all since two months(following the US market) and maybe the next next leg of downturn has started. So scripbox is doing nothing magical but following the market.\n\nthe best bet for a lay investor who is not timing the market is SIP.. 6% drawdown in last 3 months seems par for the course given how markets have fared. No fault lies with scripbox here. Don't stop your lont term investments after 3 months.\n\nAlthough, I would suggest moving to Direct plans instead of regular. Head over to /r/indiainvestments and go through the wiki.",

As much as this is fucked up, what I still don't understand is why such articles and some people assume that being the most literate state means the people/police of that state won't commit crimes? Its impossible to create a crime free state/country, Russia is nearly 100% literate, does that mean there are no crimes or crimes by the police committed there?\n\n\nArticle titles like this is insinuating and baiting for comments like \"Hur dur what's the point of being most literate if shit like this happens\" \n\n\nInstead of focusing on whether the accused have been suspended (they have) or apprehended etc, its focused on the literacy of the state, pathetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Police torture everyone in Kerala if they're not rich enough to pay them off\n\nSource: I'm from Kerala  Just because of his hair? WTF! This is reminiscent of the Delhi incident where Nido Taniam was killed for having blond hair and wearing red pants. Literate is never equal to educated. Kerala is one of the most orthodox states. This is state-sponsored terrorism of a marginalised community. Okay, I don't think anybody argues Kerala is a utopia.

    "comment" : " Adityanath and Hindutva torchbearers need to be taught the true meaning of ~~‘secular’~~ Hinduism. The author made sense till\n\n> The spirit of the Constitution is violated if any religious leader from a religious organisation or a religious institution becomes a political leader and holds an official governmental position of power. The breach of the Constitutional ideal has already happened in India. \n\nWhat nonsense! So spirit of Constitution is violated because a religious leader fights elections and wins? \n\n\n> This was pointed out by eminent jurist Fali S Nariman when the mahant of Gorakhnath Math was chosen to become the chief minister of India's most-populated state.\n\nThe same Nariman who is a parsi priest? Wasn't he also chosen to be supreme court judge? Fuck, Nariman didn't even face elections or was chosen by elected representatives - he was selected by collegium This article talks about maligning the word \"secular\" but does not talk about why this is happening. Under the garb of secularism, political parties of the past did do all kinds of weird shit. Now the majority is voting as a single block. This village idiot and his yahoos are challenging the 'basic structure' of the Constitution from a privilege constitutional seat. India has gone down another notch in backwardness. Man that headline and that pic. Just the right cocktail for stirring the pot.  For too fucking long we have been dosed with the british version of secularism . Its time to embrace the hindu version.  Seems like he is pointing out that only atheists should hold political power Rehne do Bhai. Hamare bas ki baath nahi hai.\n\n[Let it be. We are not capable of making them understand.]",

The same 22 languages are maintained in 2011 census also.\n\nThe non-scheduled languages are 99 in 2011 against 100 in 2001. The decrease\nin the number is due to exclusion of Simte and Persian, which were not\nreturned in sufficient numbers as 2011, and inclusion of Mao, which has\nreturned more than 10,000 speakers at the all-India level at 2011 census.\n\nOf the total population of India, 96.71 percent have one of the scheduled\nlanguages as their mother tongue, the remaining 3.29 per cent is accounted for\nother languages.\n\nThere are total 270 identifiable mother tongues which have returned 10,000 or\nmore speakers each at the all-India level, comprising 123 mother tongues\ngrouped under the scheduled languages and 147 mother tongues grouped under the\nnon-scheduled languages.\n\nThose languages and dialects which have returned less than 10,000 speakers\neach and which have been classified under a particular language, are included\nin \"others\" under that language.\n\nThe Eighth Schedule of the Constitution consists of the following 22 languages\n--\n\nAssamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam,\nManipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu,\nUrdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri.\n\nOf these languages, 14 were initially included in the Constitution.

    "comment" : " Surprised to see the jump after 2014. I wonder how _that_ happened? Gujarat Model™ slowly getting exposed, which the 31% of idiots believed without having any background checks about the guy who was selling it. There are much worse things to know about that sorry ass of state, in health, education, hunger index, malnutrition etc. UN every year screamed out to us how that state is actually worse than Bihar and UP. But you wouldn't know that because of it's RTI killings and no media focus at all. Because you don't hear bad things about a state does not mean it is in good condition. Infact, it is much worse when you don't know things and are not made to know things. Would be nice to have a breakup of the honour killings detailing which castes and religions were involved and the caste or religion of the killers. ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Gujarat ranks third in number of honour killings** \n\n ______ \nAHMEDABAD: In a revelation that runs contrary to Gujarat's so-called\nprogressive image, the state reported 30 cases of honour killings in three\nyears, the third highest number in the country. If the figures are adjusted\nfor population, Gujarat ranks fourth in the country in honour killings per\ncrore population, between 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe so-called model state lags just behind comparatively the underdeveloped\nstates of\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nand\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\n, which had 148 and 39 cases of honour killing respectively, between 2014 and\n2016. When adjusted for the population, Gujarat moves to the fourth spot,\nafter\n\nPunjab\n\n, where 21 cases were registered.\n\nAccording to figures from the Union home ministry, Gujarat reported 2 cases of\nhonour killings in 2014, which rose to 21 cases in 2015. In 2016, the state\nreported seven cases of honour killings under section 302 (murder) of the\nIndian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nGujarat is far ahead of Haryana, which has a particularly regressive image due\nto existence of khap panchayats there. Haryana reported six cases of honour\nkilling between 2014 and 2016, and is far behind the PM's home state when\nfigures are adjusted for population.\n\nThese figures are alarming especially as the state recently witnessed a spate\nof incidents of 'shame killings' as perpetrators believed the victim would\nbring shame or dishonour to them.\n\nGaurang\n\nJani\n\n, a city-based sociologist, said the higher figures of UP and MP were because\nthose states have larger populations than Gujarat.\n\n\"Gujarat was never progressive in terms of caste and communal harmony and it\nhas never had an amicable environment for inter-religious and inter-caste\nmarriages with its history of horrific and frequent communal riots and two\nanti-reservation agitations. The social structure of this state was never open\nto reform,\" said Jani.\n\n\"We do not see marriages between so-called upper caste persons and so-called\nlower caste persons. Besides, marriages between Hindus and Muslims are\ntargeted and face protests with the rising chorus about 'love jihad',\" added\nJani.\n\nJani said it is mainly the girls that are killed in honour killings by their\nparents, to avert so called 'shame' on the family.\n\nGujarat home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja was not available for comment on the\nissue.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

Looks like Indigo wants to wrap up their services from here I have flown Indigo and Jet Airways and boy! what a difference in hospitality and services at the almost same price.\n\nIndigo does not even care to provide infant safety belt while taking off and landing. Jet Airways service was way superior and, since I was traveling with a baby, they made an extra effort to ensure I had a comfortable trip. [deleted] Indigo's before-time guarantees are a massive scam. DGCA should regulate this nonsense. Why do I need to arrive at the airport earlier for Indigo flights than other airline companies?

Merely because her husband belongs to a Scheduled\nCaste category, she should not have been issued with a caste certificate\nshowing her caste as Scheduled Caste,\" the bench said.\n\nThe woman was issued a caste certificate in 1991 by the district magistrate of\nBulandshahr certifying her as of Scheduled Caste. Based on the academic\nqualifications and caste certificate, she was appointed as a Post Graduate\nTeacher in 1993 at Kendriya Vidyalaya at Pathankot in Punjab. During the\ncourse of her service, she completed her M.Ed.\n\nTwo decades after her appointment, a complaint was filed against her seeking\ncancellation of her appointment, alleging she had illegally taken the benefit\nof reservation without belonging to Scheduled Caste category. After conducting\nan inquiry, authorities cancelled her caste certificate and Kendriya Vidalaya\nterminated her job in 2015. Challenging KV's decision, she approached the\nAllahabad HC which dismissed her plea, and upheld her termination. She then\napproached the apex court for relief.\n\nTaking into account her unblemished service of over two decades, the SC\nmodified the HC order and said the order of termination from service shall be\ntreated as the order of compulsory retirement. \"While exercising leniency, we\nhave also kept in mind that she has neither played fraud nor misrepresented\nbefore authorities for getting the caste certificate... No questions were\nraised against her till the complaint ... came to be lodged, even when the\nauthorities had seen the high school certificate, marksheet etc. showing her\ncaste as Agarwal...\" the bench said.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

A lot of such blockbuster deals did not have much markdown below their usual prices, but the 10% cashback was helpful. I had looked at four car vacuum cleaners in blockbuster deals, each marked down by only Rs 50. However, the 10% cashback would make them 150-250rs cheaper. Since we are talking about Amazon i always wondered if the quiz they make us take to win lucky draw. Had actually anyone won it and got notified or products delivered? 6% claimed already.\n\nBunk the maths class pay the toll",

On first leg of campaign, Rahul Gandhi likely to visit 4 religious places** \n\n ______ \nWritten by\n\nJohnson T A\n\n| Bengaluru |\n\nUpdated: February 8, 2018 7:32 am\n\nCongress president Rahul Gandhi will tour northernmost parts of Karnataka from\nFebruary 10 to 13 (Express Photo/Tashi Tobgyal/File)\n\nThe itinerary for Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s first-leg tour indicates\nthe party may continue with a strategy it adopted in the recent Gujarat polls\nof subtly appealing to Hindu voters with temple visits by its chief\ncampaigner. Among key stops on the schedule are places with a Hindu temple,\ntwo Lingayat religious centres, and a Muslim dargah.\n\nRahul is scheduled to tour the districts of Bellary, Koppal, Raichur, Yadgir,\nGulbarga and Bidar, in northernmost parts of the state, from February 10 to\n13.\n\nWhile state Congress leaders claim that no deliberate thought was given to the\nreligious stopovers, the nature of places chosen reveals careful planning.\nMuch of the territory Rahul will cover is inhabited by Lingayats, the single\nlargest community in Karnataka.\n\nFollowers of 12th century poet-saint Basaveshwara, Lingayats are identified as\nHindus and are the electoral base of BJP in the state — former chief minister\nB S Yeddyurappa, BJP’s chief ministerial candidate and state unit chief, comes\nfrom the community. The Lingayats are, however, currently engaged in an\ninternal battle for separation from Hindu religion, an effort that is seen to\nhave received subtle support from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s Congress\ngovernment.\n\nIt is widely believed that the Congress will need to take away Lingayat votes\nin north Karnataka from the BJP to stand a chance of returning to power.\n\nThe first religious stop designated for Rahul during the first leg of his tour\nis at Huligamma Temple, a religious place more than a thousand years old in\nHuligi village on the banks of Tungabhadra river in Koppal district. Durga is\nbelieved to be manifested in the form of a rock there.\n\nThe second scheduled stop, at Gavisiddeshwara Mutt, is a prominent Lingayat\nmonastery in the same district, headed by the seer Abhinava Gavi Siddheshwara\nSwami. The mutt is over 800 years old and has deep reach within villagers of\nthe region on account of its efforts at spiritual, educational and health\noutreach.\n\nRahul is next scheduled to visit Khwaja Bande Nawaz dargah in Gulbarga\ndistrict. The dargah, mausoleum of the famous Sufi saint Khwaja Bande Nawaz,\nis visited by people of all communities in the region.\n\nThe final religious stop, as per the itinerary, will be Anubhava Mantapa — at\nBasavakalyan in Bidar district — a seat of religious thought and reflection\nfor the Lingayat community.\n\nWhile announcing Rahul’s tour programme recently, State Congress president G\nParameshwara had said: “There are no scheduled visits to temples during the\nfirst (leg of) visit. But if he is invited in an informal way to participate\nin a temple ritual during his visit, he will participate. It is not a form of\nsoft Hindutva but inclusive Hindutva that we (Congress party) follow.”\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

The protests, online and on-field, against the lifting of the ban on the APSC triggered debates over the theories and the legacies of Ambedkar and Periyar on sites ranging from the streets to television studios.\n\n> The debates took place primarily between the followers of Ambedkar and Periyar on one side and Hindutva “theoreticians” on the other. **Interestingly, Hindutva theoreticians, who are out to appropriate a sanitised legacy of Ambedkar, found strange bedfellows in a section of Dalit intellectuals, who, of late, have been questioning Periyar’s credentials as a crusader for the socially oppressed, accusing him of having a bias in favour of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and against Dalits**.\n\n> Hindutva theoreticians argue that Ambedkar and Periyar can not be considered equals and put on the same footing as far as social reform is concerned. And they have for company a section of Dalit leaders and writers. **They invoke the name of Dr Ambedkar freely but fail to realise that he had no issues with the social reform movement in Tamil Nadu extending the struggle to Dalits as well**.\n\n> **Hindutva elements, which have been on a relentless mission to appropriate the legacy of Ambedkar, resurrected some clichéd arguments against Periyar, saying that he was a pro-OBC leader who worked against the interests of Dalits. The idea was to win over Dalits to their side by driving a wedge between them and the OBCs**. Unfortunately, some neo-Dalit intellectuals and fringe Tamil nationalist groups, which have been critical of Periyar and his reforms and view with suspicion any activism other than their own, seem to be playing into the hands of these elements.\n\n> Periyar and Ambedkar undoubtedly had many commonalities on the social front, and a few differences which were not big enough to cast them as polar opposites as some Hindutva “ideologues” seek to do. **A discerning reader who sifts through their writings and speeches cannot miss the similarities between their approaches. Both campaigned stridently against Hinduism, which, according to them, sanctioned and ideologically justified the pernicious caste system**. Ambedkar, a Mahar from Indore, embraced Buddhism, exasperated over his community’s continued exclusion from the social structure; Periyar, an OBC, remained in the Hindu fold “to exercise my moral right to criticise it”, in his words... It is lost on me why the RSS-supporting-right-wingers, who are so eager to mis-read Periyar's political philosophy (as represented by his ideological think-tank DK, not necessarily upheld by political offshoots DMK or ADMK), stay awfully silent when it comes to **caste-views of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the founder of Hindutva ideology**.\n\n> [“The ancient Ganges of our blood has come down from the altitudes of the sublime Vedic heights to the plains of our modern history fertilising much, incorporating many a noble stream and purifying many a lost soul, increasing   in volume and richness, defying the danger of being lost in bogs and sands and flows today, refreshed and reinvigorated more than ever. **All that the caste system has done is to regulate its noble blood on the lines believed – and on the whole rightly believed – by our saintly and patriotic law-givers and kings** to contribute most to fertilise and enrich all that was barren and poor, without famishing and debasing all that was flourishing and nobly endowed.”](https://scroll.in/article/774610/why-the-intolerance-debate-is-far-from-over) [Tamil Nadu leads in crimes against dalits](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-leads-in-crimes-against-dalits/articleshow/60077686.cms) Periyar didn't do anything for Dalits",

    "comment" : " Misleading headline, since it includes Bihar which wasn't ruled by BJP for a substantial portion of time under consideration. But the statistics are nonetheless interesting. When will this stupid country get rid of caste system? Buried by downvotes.\nCareful , these are the posts that should be up there at the discussion table but some bitches who run around taunting others with \"important issues are there to discuss\" are interestingly absent from the said posts. It's for you to see, \"silent majority\" this is how shit goes down here. They can publish 1001 stories like this of atrocities against Dalits in India and bootlickers will always respond to the tune of 'it's not about caste'.\n\n[This video of Muhammad Ali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd9aIamXjQI) is so apt for the situation of Dalits and minorities in India. The bhakts want us to fight someone else as our 'enemy' when they are the true problem.\n Of course.  Shocker. ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**5 BJP ruled states have highest crime rates against Dalits, reveals NCRB data** \n\n ______ \nHighlights 1 Madhya Pradesh recorded highest crime rate against Dalits.\n\n2 UP recorded highest number of crime against Dalits.\n\n3 Gujarat has seen rise in crime against Dalits during 2014-16.\n\nThe latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) may give the Opposition a shot in arm for the Gujarat Assembly election. The latest data for 2014-16 reveals that the BJP ruled states recorded highest crime rates against scheduled castes.\n\nThe NCRB data, released today says that the five states that recorded the highest crime rate in the category of \"crime/atrocities against scheduled castes\" during 2014-16 were all ruled by the BJP directly or in alliance with other parties.\n\nMadhya Pradesh occupies the top position in crime against scheduled castes in terms of crime rate, which is defined by the incidence of crime recorded per one lakh population. Madhya Pradesh registered 3,294 incidents of crime against scheduled castes in 2014 followed by 3,546 in 2015 and 4,922 last year.\n\nMadhya Pradesh reported 12.1 per cent of total number of crimes against scheduled castes registered in the country last year. Madhya Pradesh is followed by Rajasthan, which recorded 12.6 per cent of total number of crimes recorded against scheduled castes in the country in 2016.\n\nOTHER BJP STATES\n\nRajasthan recorded 6,735 incidents of crime against scheduled castes in 2014, which declined to 5,911 in 2015 and 5,136 in 2016. Goa holds third position in terms of crime rate against scheduled castes. However, in terms of numbers, Goa recorded only 13 such cases each in 2014 and 2015 while the number of crime against scheduled castes declined to 11 last year.\n\nWith 5,701 incidents of crime reported against scheduled castes last year, Bihar stood fourth in the table. Bihar's share in the all India figure for crime against scheduled caste was 14 per cent for 2016. The\n\nBJP is in alliance with the JD-U in Bihar, which had voted for the grand alliance (including RJD and Congress) in 2015. But, early this year, Nitish Kumar walked out of the grand alliance and stitched an alliance with the BJP to form government.\n\nWILL NCRB DATA IMPACT GUJARAT ELECTION?\n\nElection-bound Gujarat was at the fifth rank in terms of crime rate against scheduled castes. Gujarat has seen an increase in the number of incidents of crime against scheduled castes since 2014.\n\nThe NCRB data shows that Gujarat registered 1,094 incidents of crime against scheduled castes which increased to 1,322 in 2016. In 2015, Gujarat recorded a minor dip in the number when 1,010 incidents of crime against scheduled castes were registered in the state.\n\nDuring this period, Gujarat has seen several agitations over rising crime against Dalits in the state. The crime against Dalits took political turn in 2015 when a family was attacked by cow vigilantes at Una.\n\nThe issue of crime against Dalits is one of the major poll issues for Gujarat Assembly election. Dalit leaders including Jignesh Mevani and the Congress have been raising the issue of crime against scheduled castes in the state for past couple of years.\n\nAccording to the NCRB data, atrocities or crime against scheduled castes increased by 5.5 per cent in 2016 over 2015. A total of 40,801 cases of crime against scheduled castes were registered in the country in 2015 compared to 38,670 cases in 2015.\n\nWith 10,426 incidents, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of cases of atrocities against scheduled castes accounting for 25.6 per cent followed by Bihar with 14 per cent and Rajasthan with 12.6 per cent in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the rate of crime against scheduled castes of total cognisable crimes in Madhya Pradesh was 43.4 per cent followed by 42 per cent in Rajasthan, 36.7 per cent in Goa, 34.4 per cent in Bihar and 32.5 per cent in Gujarat. The all-India crime rate against scheduled castes was 20.6 per cent last year.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

    "comment" : " Anyone else addicted to Football manager?  Just started playing the metal gear series on ps3 and 4. 6 games to go.  been getting back into super old school text adventures. The advantage is the graphics processor is your brain and not limited by current technology or cost.\n\nOther advantage is you can play it while in office.\n\nI have been replaying [Counterfeit Monkey by Emily Short](http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/) last week. you have a device that can remove letter from the objects. So removing \"x\" from **codex**, gives you **code** to open the door. you can make **garage** from **garbage** and **car** from **chard**. \n\nThe story is very interesting. It has multiple possible endings and there are lot of achievements to get. Its fun to see what objects you can make in this world. So replay-ability value is very high.\n\nIt will be most appreciated by Language nerds and computer nerds alike. Okay. So this may not be your typical comment, please be kind :)   \nI'm looking to get back into gaming after a really really long time. The last games that I played were the first Assassin's Creed, the old NFS:Shift/Undercover/World titles and such (read games from '08).  \n  \nSo first up, PC or console? I've only ever played on a PC (that I built). If i'm not mistaken (and please correct me here), many titles are console-specific. So, X-Box? PS4? Or PC?  \n  \nAnd some good titles to get started?  \n**Edit:** And for online gaming, what typical internet speeds would be required? Playing Uncharted 2. I would never stop being amazed at whatever Naughty Dogs develop. Not a single moment of boredom in the game. \nAlso playing Hitman (2016), the number ways you can kill your target is more than enough to warrant 30+ hours in the game. The very definition of a fun game.  Give a shot to **War Thunder**.  Much more realistic than world of tanks,  has air, ground and naval (in beta)  and feels much more satisfying. \n\nCons: the grind is real in tier4 tanks. Russian developers,  who do stupid things at times. Cyka blyat.  [removed] **Attention Smartphone Gamers**, could you tell the game you're hooked on playing right now? Trying out this game called Aragami. Pretty cool stealth game. Basically, you're some sort of a shadow ninja. Haven't played much of it though. Other games in the pipeline include Metro 2033 and MGS: The Phantom Pain. Nothing but Overwatch for the past couple of months. PM me for battletag. \n\nFinished Inside and Child of Light on the side. Both way shorter than I would like them and not as difficult as you'd expect them to be. But both are fantastic with their own charm.\n\nPlayed a bit of Super Meat Boy. It's definitely an intense and old-school-difficult game.\n\nReally want to return to Smite, but just too lazy to learn the S4 meta considering I barely played S3. Stardew Valley. Started playing it in the first week of Jan and already 50+ hours into it. Still so much to do. \n\nVery relaxing and addictive :-)",

The Call of Duty games have always had fun single-player campaigns IMO but I've never wanted to pay full price just for the campaigns - so I managed to buy them all off this site and played through all of them.\n\nMS released the Mass Effect trilogy playable on Xbox One and I had EA Access so got all of them for free. I was a penniless college student when they came out and I never played any of the DLC for 2 & 3, so I paid for all the story DLC and started with ME2, starting with a default background. This has turned out to be a mistake because Ashley and Wrex are dead. Wrex I can maybe live without but it was really hard to get over not having Ashley around (she is Shepard's bae in my playthroughs) plus Kaidan is generally an asshole. I played through ME2 anyway and somehow got Jack killed, which was another blow. Unfortunately, when I went to cure the genophage in ME3, I realised that because I chose to save Maelon's data Eve was alive, so I couldn't convince Mordin to pretend to cure the genophage. I had to make the hard choice, I had to do it. I couldn't let Urdnot Wreav start the Krogan Rebellions again. I had to kill Mordin Solus.\n\nI had to stop playing after that. Now I'm going to have to go back to ME1, and keep Wrex alive and let that asshole Kaidan die, as a bonus I get to keep the rachni around as well. Sigh. Nobody here keen on playing Watch Dogs 2? Any 3DS users here? I've been hooked to the new Pokémon for a week now. Great new addition to the series I recently started playing Borderlands and Mirrors Edge again. In love with these games.\n\nAlso, does anyone play War Thunder ? Mass Effect Andromeda !!! Neverwinter Nights is available for free on Gog.com for anyone interested in RPGs like Baldur's gate.",

    "comment" : " There are 2002 reasons not to define it. >Genocide as a crime is not given any legal recognition in the laws of our country including Indian Penal Code, 1860 , though there are provisions which make some acts which maybe otherwise taken to be in the nature of genocide as culpable offences. In this chapter we will deal with every aspect of Indian Penal Laws that help make such acts offences or provide exceptions or immunity to the government or any other aspect of any law with regards to offences which may constitute the essentials of genocide.\n\n>Impunity Given to the Government\n\n>In substantive terms, Indian law remains unable to conceptualize the mass crime within the inadequate framework of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which is better suited to deal with individual crimes. Taken a step further Indian law refuses to entertain the possibility of the state being accountable for offences it might commit. This is made explicit in Sec 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr P.C) which lays down that the sanction of the Government both Central and State is necessary before the prosecution of a public servant for acts committed in the discharge of his duty. Indian law entrenches impunity in law for its officials for offences it might commit against its citizens. The question of justice within the framework of Indian law will have to grapple with both the substantive and procedural provisions in the IPC and the Cr. P.C.\n\n>The philosophy of the Indian Penal Code in providing immunity to those in control of the state of course makes sense when we understand that the IPC was drafted in 1860 and was an instrument of ensuring colonial control. In that context the classification offences includes among others the categories of offences against the body, offences against property and offences against the state. The significant omission in this classification remains the idea of offences by the state.\n\n>Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989\n\n>The only possible exception in terms of conceptualizing crimes against a collectivity is the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which provides a brilliant ethnography of crimes against members of a specific community by actually fifteen different ways in which SC/ ST are deprived of their rights. The listing of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is a fairly accurate description of the kinds of offences to which SC/ST communities are subject to in independent India. It concretes describes what the Rome Statute might have called persecution.\n\n>The history of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 can be traced back to  Article 17 of the Constitution is that provision of our constitutional mandate through which untouchability was abolished and its practice in any form forbidden. Despite clear and specific constitutional provisions guaranteeing every individual’s right to a life of dignity, equality and non-discrimination, the shameful existence of caste-based discrimination and denials made this specific articulation on untouchability a necessity at the point of time when the Constitution was drafted. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 was enacted in order to enforce this constitutional provision.\n\n>Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill\n\n>The one opportunity to take the question of mass crime seriously was the promise of the UPA government to ‘enact a model comprehensive law to deal with communal violence’.  This promise was made in the Common Minimum Programme (CMP). The reason for this provision finding a place in the CMP was clearly the horrific communal violence in Gujarat in 2002 under the former National Democratic Alliance (NDA). To implement this promise, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has introduced the Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005. Even prior to the introduction of the 2005 Bill, there were a series of bills circulated by both the state and civil society which sought to deal with aspects of mass crimes. \n\n>The Bill does not seriously consider any of the points made above and makes a mockery of any serious efforts to tackle state impunity for mass crimes. The critical analysis of the said Bill has been incorporated in the following segment.\n\n>Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2009\n\n>The government’s final version of the communal violence law empowers the Centre to take charge of an area where riots have broken out once it sends in central forces, if it finds the state government concerned reluctant to act against the rioters. The new law still does not allow the Centre to send armed forces on its own to a riot-hit spot.[25] But once a state has asked for central forces to quell violence, the Centre will have the right under certain circumstances of setting up a unified command, comprising these forces and the local police.\n\n>The Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, however, says the Centre can declare an area “communally disturbed” and take direct charge only if the state concerned refuses to act against the violence being perpetrated to such an extent that the secular fabric of the country, or internal security, is endangered. To guard against political misuse, the law stipulates that the Centre must first draw the attention of the state government to the deteriorating state of affairs, and set a deadline for it to take necessary steps to suppress the violence. Until now, central forces deployed in a state worked under the control of the local district administration. But henceforth, in special circumstances, it will work under the unified command, which will report to the Centre\n\n[Source](https://www.lawctopus.com/academike/genocide-indian-perspective/)",

However, no arrest has been made so far.\n\nThe accused reportedly assaulted bridegroom Baljinder Singh, a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan and members of the marriage party over an issue as they were getting ready to leave for the bride’s place.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Scheduled Castes Alliance president Paramjit Singh Kainth has intervened in the matter and spoke to the IG Border Range, Amritsar, Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, and got a case registered against the accused.\n\nKainth said on Saturday,”The incident is a prime example of the social boycott and social harassment that scheduled castes have to face, as the groom was not even allowed to ride a horse by upper caste assailants.”\n\nHe said, “The groom, his family members and even relatives were not spared. Women were attacked and many even lost their belongings. “ The SSP said that justice will be delivered to the victims of violence in this case.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

The Rajya Sabha then passed the bill but with certain amendments. This resulted in two different versions of the bill being passed by the two houses. Therefore, the bill will now have to be reintroduced in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe NCBC, a statutory body created in 1993, was given limited powers -- only to recommend to the government inclusion or exclusion of a community in the central list of OBCs.\n\nThe power to hear complaints of OBCs and protect their interests continued to be with the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.\n\nSince the National Commission for Scheduled Castes deals with grievances and safeguards of SCs as well as OBCs, it has limited capacity to address needs of OBCs, an official explained.\n\n\"This bill, when enacted into a law, will not only make the NCBC a constitutional body, but will also empower the NCBC to hear complaints of OBCs, protect their interests and safeguard their rights,\" he said.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

In the second episode the Adivasi were mentioned and I was hoping for some more information. Sorry that I will just be listing the questions in numbered form, one after another, but it may be helpful if people respond with only one or more answer and can number them accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If a group is considered to be Adivasi are they also considered to be a Scheduled Tribe? Meaning, is Adivasi the exact same thing as Scheduled Tribe? Or are they completely different things and if so then what is the specific difference?\n\n​\n\n2. How does a group get officially recognized by the Indian government to be Adivasi?\n\n3. Are there Adivasi groups in Karnataka? Where could I find a list of these specific groups? Is this anywhere online?\n\n4. And lastly, does anyone know of any Adivasi groups located near Belgavi in Northern Karnataka? If so, where exactly do they live and what is their group name?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and consideration!!",

While discussing on +2 student Anita's death and NEET exam, the question of his daughter's admission came up. Apparently while his daughter refuses to divulge her marks over live call, he cooks up a random number in front of live cameras. Newschannel's upload [here] (https://youtu.be/mix22DL0qgw?t=33m5s) As expected, there's [more to it](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decision-on-mbc-status-for-thevar-community-after-castebased-census/article2160131.ece) than meets the eye (link from a 2011 report). \n\nThis particular community wants to be renamed **Most** Backward Class instead of their current status — Backward Class. Needless to say, it'll come with extra perks than existing ones. Plus, there's a whole lot of politics involved. In other words, this is pretty specific to TN. Maybe someone from TN can comment on this further. \n\nSwarajya, as expected, spun it to a whole new level and included a broader Hindu element to it.  Yes i'd prefer reservation to be Socio-economic based but a combination of the two would also work very fine \n\nEvery year we on medical camps to villages and distribute free medicine to improve the health condition of \"Harijana\" and \"Girijana\" the tribal population \n\nMost of them still live in forests, some don't even have basic house, some get government built houses \n\nWhat i observed was that majority of them suffer from anemia, and the translator guy we had told us that they live on day to day basis, foraging in the forest and selling the nuts and fruits collected to buy basic food and alcohol \n\nThe parents don't send their kids to school as they want them to help with foraging, for them i'd love see more programs in sector of education and jobs, affirmative action for these people is very much needed \n\nboth on the other hand there should be a limit to reservation too, reservation after UG studies should be abolished, the % of reservation given should be standardized etc         /r/AsABlackMan  Before removing Ambedkar's reservations, remove Mandal's reservations. Anyway reservation was ammended more than the intended time by Ambedkar by others. http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/010817/documentary-filmmaker-receives-threat-calls-from-section-of-dalits.html \n\n>Divya Bharathi, the young woman documentary film maker of Kakoos (Toilet) on Monday alleged that she has been getting threat calls and abusive messages from persons claiming to be members of the Dalit outfit, Puthiya Tamilagam (PT) party and of BJP.\n\nsounds like a perfect ally. no wonder swarajyamag is spewing its shit",

I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace.",

[Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion. Check out videos of [JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/videos) \\- he does photography and good YouTube videos as a hobby while serving on a merchant vessel. Don't watch 3 idiots in a loop. >Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications\n\nYou can join photography college/school. There are many. Also look into online classes\n\nIf you've a DSLR, try practicing on your own. Shoot in manual. \n\nAlso parallely, learn photoshop/GIMP/Lightroom. People find it tough.

    "comment" : " My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   \n\"Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters\".   \n    \nThat dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  \n    \n    \nPhotography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. \nWe used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  \nEvery wasted frame was crime. It depends.\n\n I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.\n\nCrystal clear photographs != good photography. \n\nA good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.\n\nThat being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.\n\nMost people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. \n\nSo yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.\nP.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai.",

I also came across Tanotis where I've ordered some Kodak gold from. I'm still waiting for the delivery. Check them out, they seem to have lots of good stuff for analog photographers, including darkroom equipment.\n\nNot sure about Delhi, but I've heard of a Eastern photography company that stocks film?\n\nGood luck with your search I bought 35mm rolls from random camera shops in Gautam Nagar, Chandni Shop and some in Gurgaon (Galleria, Vyapar Kendra etc). You might not get a well stocked shop but you will get a couple here and there. Best bet is to ask someone to buy it from abroad and send it to you. You get a better variety of rolls too.\n\nJust keep trying odd camera shops (Kodak/Fujifilm type stores that used to develop the rolls at first) wherever you spot them around in Delhi.

There is a small community of photographers who still shoot analog. Analog photography is viable in India but the costs  would be high, it would also depend on where you live. Most shops have gone digital and stopped processing film in many cities, so if you can't find a shop to process the film then there are ways to do it online.\n\nYou can get used film cameras in good condition from ebay. There's a store in Bangalore called film foto store, they also have a website through which they sell film rolls, accessories as well as processing. The film rolls are a bit expensive though.  \n\nI've been looking at doing it for sometime now, I'll have to until I can afford to do it. As a profession, no, as a hobby, yes.",

Bigger question, do dash cameras actually survive Indian heat on the dash? I use one. Got a $40 Chinese made one that had a very good rating on Amazon  from Amazon-US through a friend visiting here. \n\nWorks perfect. Has a 8GB memory card and stores last 4 hours of video I guess. I leave my car in the hot Sun and the camera seems to work just fine. Has a very wide almost 170 degree viewing angle. The battery backup lasts just for 10 seconds allowing the camera to shut itself down properly when disconnected. I leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. Got a splitter for the lighter socket so I have one more slot for charging my mobile when needed. \n\nIts good to have the dash cam, especially in India. A very small investment but could save you from a mess. Haven't had to use it but I think they are acceptable as evidence if needed.  I use my old Redmi 2 with the Dailyroads app The Rexing V1\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/V1-Dashboard-Recorder-G-Sensor-Recording/dp/B00X528FNE\n\nThis. I ordered this on Amazon USA a few months ago. \n\nIt's a reliable dash cam.\n\nAlso, slightly unrelated but I believe that the trick to seeing whether a product is reliable via the Amazon review section is to see the one star review percentage. For this it hovers around 8% which is kinda okay. The same being in single digits is always preferable.\n There is a sub for this, /r/Dashcam/  \nMore informed people there regarding the product options.  Get a Street Guardian if you can afford it.  I think they are illegal to use in India since you can't take photos of bridges. I just use my gopro.",

    "comment" : " > or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?\n\nthis. read the papers you signed when you joined your current company. It's standard practice among employers to include a clause that forbids you from moonlighting. So in all likelihood, your company should have that too. Ultimately, it depends on how cool they are with you doing a side business (provided they come to know). \n\nAlmost everyone makes secondary income from equities, real estate, etc. and companies don't bother about that. But whatever you do, make sure you do not use any company resources (including office hours).  Do it in somebody else's name. \n\nLike an elderly relative or not working sibling.\n\n As long as your freelance stuff is not connected in any way to your full time job it should be fine. But do check your employment contract, company code of conduct and perhaps get written confirmation from your company's legal team. Just don't tell your employer or get caught. Talk to you manager/HR. As long as there isn't any **Conflict of Interest** situation, you should be allowed to do so. But it all depends on how anal your manager/company decides to be. The company I used to work for, before going full-time freelance, were pretty cool and had no restrictions on me doing a freelance side job, which I did over weekends, holidays or whenever I took leave. \n  \nDo note that you will have to file your taxes for this extra income separately. So make sure to talk to a CA before doing so. > does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?\n\nOf course this.\n\nIn addition to checking that, there is a simpler logic you could apply. \n\nDon't focus on the end-product if it competes with your company, **focus on the tools**. If the tools are same, then you might land in trouble.\n\nFor e.g. Write Code for Day Job. Make Samosa as free lancer. Quite Safe\n\nWrite Code for Day Job. Make Graphic Design as free lancer. Somewhat Safe.\n\nWrite Code for Day Job. Writes Games as free lancer. Hmm... Maybe Safe, but someone can always claim you copied some algorithms.\n\nYou get the general idea, I hope. ",

I missed a couple of posts last time, but if anybody is interested in it please pm me. [deleted] I loved collecting Stamps. I still have so many of them. I wonder if this hobby is dying.  Balcony gardening counts? I want to learn drawing, doodling. Do you guys see those comics online like XKCD, Commit Strip etc? I want to do something like that. So where and how do I begin? [deleted] Made a website (very little content): [Unfilled Space](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/)\nIts not ready for mobile yet. You will see no \"modern design\" if you open it on a mobile.\n\nHere's a justification/apology for making such a website:\n[Unfilled Space / A New Social](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/p/a_new_social.html)\n\nYou can make your own site for free at [Neocities!](https://neocities.org)\n\n-----------------------\n\n**A note on Websites for the absolute beginner**\n\nWebsites are basically just documents.\n\n_The real way_\n\nIf you have a piece of text you want to turn into a website, you just have to do add some special formatting so that all computers around the world, made by different corporations and running on different software understand it in the same manner. This formatting is not very different from the way you apply formatting to Reddit comments. It is called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). So instead of using ** to make a piece of text **bold**, you'll have to write <b>bold</b>, and so on. Granted, writing HTML is boring business and requires great motivation (only) in the beginning. It soon becomes second nature.\n\nI learnt HTML in this [easy tutorial in 3 parts](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/), only the first part is enough to get a working webpage.\n\n_The easy way_\n\nIf you do not want to write HTML you can simply write up a page in MS Word and from the File Menu you will be able to save the page as an HTML file. When this file is uploaded to a fixed location (website address, such as one created using [Neocities](https://neocities.org)), people around the world can read it. (Neocities also has an HTML tutorial but I haven't tried it.)\n\nEdit: Added a note on websites",

Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.\n\nYou make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.\n\n*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer. If they accept without a counter, your quote was too low.* I got in touch with a third party company in Chennai that wanted photogs to go around and take pics for Swiggy in Chennai,  They pay was 350 bucks per restaurant and  I had to shoot 3 restaurants a day along with 14 or more pics per restaurant.  That amounted to 1050 bucks a day and that doesn't even cover the cost of a days rental for my camera, so I politely told them to fuck off.",

As an avid amateur photographer this irks me the most, when I encounter people who use flash, I try to handle the them by engaging them and saying that \"You won't get good photo with flash on\" most of the time they listen and turn their flash off.  I remember reading once that some cunt was crushing nests and eggs in them after taking photos so others wouldn't get chance to snap a pic. Motherfucker.\n\nAnyway, shit like this is why ban seems like adequate response. civic sense is fucking uncommon.

    "body" : "For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such \"old age\" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.\nI really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. \nI have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)\n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nFailure at 25.\n\n\nEdit : Thanks for the gold. 🏆\n\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the 2nd gold and 3rd silver. Much appreciated.\n\n\nEdit 3: Thanks for the platinum!\nI hope this post can give people a new direction and courage. Don't lose hope. You aren't alone.\n\nEdit 4 : Thanks for the 4th silver. I have received a lot of messages with similar problems to mine and asking for guidance. If you are someone, who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation, feel free to message me for any queries/advice/motivation.",

    "comment" : " More power to you bro. Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.\n\nJust make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. \nNow I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. \nMore power to you, to me and everyone who needs. \n\nYou'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     \n\nI am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   \n\nI did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    \n\nNone the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   \n \nAnyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   \n\nThe moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   \n JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     \n\nDon't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  \n\n\nIf you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   \n\nAnd again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   \nI leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It’s never too late to do anything. Good luck 👍",

I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. \"WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO...\" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.\n\nThis year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",

Thats because they believe every NRI has a tree in their backyard that grows money and we are plucking money from it when we fly back home.  There is no point arguing with govt officials.

He has tried everywhere but can't seem to find any good jobs. He is getting very depressed and lost interest in life. It breaks my heart to see a guy who followed his dreams and is giving up now.\n\nI do not have any idea of the career trajectory of a photographer. If you guys could shine some light on where and how he could apply or look for jobs that would help him a lot.\n\nIf you guys know of any job opening that would be great too.",

Follow your dream is bad advice for most people.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o\n\nFollow your dream during weekends as a hobby Engineering Selling your camera and its accessories is the best/fastest way to make money using a camera in India. Start some small bijiness with that money. India ain't a place for artists and non-conventional professions. Blunt truth.  \n  \nThat being said however, I hear some eretail, realestate etc sites hire photographers for cataloging etc. Then there is the urbanclapp gigs. Still my first choice would selling the camera and equipment for money.  this field has exploded and just check 500px or instagram.\n\nthere are 1000s of good photographers. good mobile phones has shown that even part time you can click great pics\n\nhe has to do lot of good and unique photography and do mundane stuff for first 5 years and then establish himself Today even a monkey with a camera is a photographer.\nSource : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie\n\nSo it is difficult get good opportunities in this field. Even If your friend is good, he has to start freelancing maybe and at first be ready to accept low fees for salary.",

    "comment" : " I am self taught and photograph semi-professionally (still mostly a hobby, but getting paid pretty well now). \n\n> What types of jobs do professional photographers get into?\n\nWeddings. If he enjoys it, there is a lot of money to be made in India. Prices for an experienced photographer range from 2-8 lakh per wedding (4 events) in Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't even for the top photographers. For someone with my experience, there is more money in Delhi, than London!\n\nThere is also even photography (corporate), and then there are regular portraits, headshots, model portfolios etc. These are like the bread and butter in the off season. Maternity and baby photography is taking off in India. Not as highly paid yet, but still around 15-20K for around a 3 hour shoot. This has a lot of potential.\n\nThere are other options like real estate and architectural photography. Lower end is not worth it, but if start getting corporate gigs, that's very well paid.\n\nThere are so many others, like product and food photography. Each is different and requires a different skill set/way of thinking. I think I am pretty bad with food. \n\n> Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k\n\nHow long has he been photographing for? Cheapest DSLR, probably a Nikon D3XXX (whichever number is current), and a 35mm prime lens (can buy used for around 5K). You can even look at a second hand camera, as long as it is in a good condition. In my opinion, you don't get enough for your money by upgrading amongst the low end cameras, so you'd rather get the cheapest and use the spare money for other gear - this helps more than, say, buying a D5XXX. Depending on what he wants to photograph, he will need a flash (look for Yongnuo - and quite okay). \n\nGood luck!\n\nBonus: [A pic I took recently](http://i.imgur.com/xOdn5U7.jpg) :)",

    "comment" : " The photographer in question is well known in Indian circles as the founder of Emaho Magazine, and is on the board choosing nominees for an award in the field of photography. Given the testimonials he's fairly likely to use the opportunity for more sexual harassment. This unfortunately happens all too frequently in Indian workplaces as evidenced by the Tarun Tejpal affair.\nAfter reading the testimonials do please share the link on facebook and cross post to other subs to spread the word. The victims have a right to have their accusations heard. Link to the original blog:\n\nhttps://iwasharassedbymanikkatyalblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/i-worked-as-a-graphic-designer-for-emaho-in-2012/ More than 20 women have claimed on a blog that photo editor Manik Katyal harassed them verbally and physically.\n\n---\n\n> * Several young women photographers, in India and abroad, have created a stir in the international photography industry after speaking out against multiple incidents of alleged sexual harassment by a photo editor, who has now been sacked from his position as a co-director of a photo festival in Delhi.While the women have not yet registered police complaints, they have been using social media for the past few days to recount personal experiences of alleged harassment by Manik Katyal, the editor-in-chief of photography magazine Emaho, headquartered in Delhi.\n\n> * Most of the online complainants have worked as junior photographers or interns at the publication, and some of their allegations of sexual harassment date back to 2012 and 2013.While most of the women claim to have experienced verbal harassment online or in person, some have also made allegations of physical abuse and coercion.On November 7, a group of photographers also created a blog titled \"I was harassed by Manik Katyal\", on which at least 20 women have posted personal testimonials in the form of write-ups, comments and screen shots of Facebook chats in which Katyal allegedly behaved in a lewd manner.In response to the flood of allegations on social media, Katyal has now been asked to step down from his role as one of the three directors of Just Another Photo Festival, a photography festival that took place in Delhi in September.\n\n> * But the main trigger that pushed many women to speak out publicly was when Emaho set up a sexual harassment committee, said another male photographer who started the complaints blog along with a few colleagues.Emaho made the announcement on November 4 on its website, stating that it had pioneered the effort of being the first Indian online magazine to constitute an independent committee which is known as Prevention of Sexual harassment and discrimination Committee.Katyal started getting praise from some people in the international photography community for starting this committee, which made many women indignant, said the blog co-founder, who believes social media is a natural platform for young adults to vent their anger and rally around each other across international boundaries.\n\n> * Meanwhile, women who claim to have faced harassment are now exploring the options of filing formal complaints either with the police or the National Commission for Women.The social media and blog campaign against Katyal has, however, already begun to garner responses from sections of the international photography industry.Even as Katyal was asked to step down from Just Another Photo Festival, a Dutch photography publishing house called Schilt Publishing announced that it had heard of some serious and disgusting allegations against a certain photo editor and that it would not ever tolerate the abuse and harassment of women photographers, or photographers of any gender, for that matter.The controversy has also sparked off serious discussions about sexual harassment in the industry and the lack of avenues for those who wish to report it.These are things that one usually gets to hear in whispers at first, said Sohrab Hura, one of only two Indians to be made a member of Magnum Photos, an acclaimed collective of international photographers.\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme Just Delhi Things what an idiotic headline.",

You are qualified to make decisions about your own mental well-being. If photography is a stress buster, use your phone camera, and a good camera app, like Lightroom. It captures RAW images, albeit not as good as a DSLR, but it will get you your fix. Graduate, then do whatever the fuck makes you happy. If you're living on their dime, they're the ones who bought you that camera and pay the fees for your masters, you focus on studying for those exams. If you're actually independent as somebody your age should be, do what you think is right for you ATM. Order/ rent a DVD of bollywood flick \"3 idiots\" and make your parents watch it.",

It's a spiral galaxy but the spirals are hard to see due to the galaxy's positioning. It's also one of the brightest deep sky objects you can see, due to its surface brightness and proximity to our Milky Way. \n\nThis was taken in Dandeli, Karnataka almost a year ago,and is one of my all-time favourite photos even if it looks bad. If you're in an extremely dark spot, you can see this galaxy with..*drumroll* **the naked eye!** \n\nIf you live long enough(a few billion years!), you can witness M31 and our own Milky Way collide together :) \n\nI used a simple Canon EOS 1100D and a focal length of 55mm to get this shot. \n\n This is amazing! Keep up the good work. \n\nAnd *moarrr*  Nice shot, man Even though Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way will collide, the distance between the individual objects are so huge that not a single thing would actually collide!\n\nSpace is fascinating, ain't it? wow! this is my hometown!",

    "body" : "I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:\n\nA few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.\n\nHowever, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the \"elders\", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the \"edlers\" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however \"allowed\" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.\n\nAbsolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.\n\nAs I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. \n\nThe second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the \"family\" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. \n\nIn IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?\n\nAdditonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(\n\nPlease keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.\n\n**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",

    "comment" : " why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:\n\n- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.\n- The mother should move in with her son here.\n- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.\n- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. \n- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.\n\nThe mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. \n\nIf you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. \n\nAnd thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you.

The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.\n\nHowever, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional.

    "comment" : " From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. \n\nProblem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. \n\nAlternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.\n\nschool jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/\n\nI support you..very nice initiative.\n\nbut..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  \n\nHow much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k? \n\nSurely you can afford that much money.",

Anyone who has prepared for NEET knows the story [deleted] They even tried to patent our 'Pranayama'; they got it renamed to 'Cardiac Coherence Breathing'. Ain't this old news? I've seen these Texmati  and American Basmati rice in 10 kg bags at Walmart when I went to Canada in 2007.

About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.\n\nThere are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source- Belong](https://i.redd.it/5qz6wrviz6d31.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **THE ROAD AHEAD**\n\nThe National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned\n\n \n\nCapital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.\n\nInvestment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector\n\n \n\n[Continue Reading](https://medium.com/@anupamasingh_12727/what-is-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-india-4c72b14729c7?utm_source=MEDUIM_REDDIT&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=gajanandswami)",

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \\- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :\n\n1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**\n2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.\n3. **Putting in a process of \"Hands On\" education and not  \"Hands free\" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **\"Hands On\"** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **\"PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS\" , \" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**\"  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via \"Interested people\". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying \"HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE\" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.\n\n**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be \"leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways\" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of \"PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT\". The push for higher fees with minimal \"restraint\" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both \"Sociologically and systematically\".**\n\nA total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources used :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.\n\nThese are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?\n\nFor as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?\n\nThey say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.\n\nI yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.\n\nConsidering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.\n\nIn case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?\n\n[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).\n\nIn case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.\n\nIf you so happen to think everything is fine & will be fine, [here's also a little something for you to consider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA).\n\nIf you wish to binge a bit more, check out [how & why the City should be a Commons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3itmhDuem8) or [a summary of commoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ake8u8tpR5U).\n\nAfter that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.\n\nProposals:—\n\n* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.\n* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.\n* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.\n* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.\n* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.\n* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.\n* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.\n* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.\n* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.\n* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons\n* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).\n* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).\n* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.\n* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.\n* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.\n* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",

    "body" : "Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. \n\nNations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. \n\nSo why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. \n\nWhen we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. \n\nDemocracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. \n\nI’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology. ",

    "comment" : " A country is not a country .....its a union of states.\n\nA state is not a state....its a union of divisions.\n\nA division is not a division.....its a union of districts.\n\nA district is not a district.....its a union of mohallas.\n\nA mohalla is not a mohalla.....its a union of families.\n\nA family is not a family....its a union of individuals.\n\nWhats the point ?? Pigs everywhere !!!! You sound pretty salty here. Let's clarify some things:\n\n1. There are nations that form for different reasons. India formed because of the of a) The British (at least in terms of their empire) and b) The Indian Freedom Fighters (who tried to keep the country consolidated after independence. Kudos particularly to Vallabhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/S8YxVMKFfwaIeLHUWCYINI/Vallabhbhai-Patel-and-the-making-of-India.html)\n\n1. Second, their rationale behind them was not to \"Collect Taxes\". Contrary to what you're saying, the fathers of our nation believed that we were better and stronger together. Patel, Nehru, Gandhi, Ambedkar, Naidu, et. al. believed keeping the Indian state intact was the natural thing to do. They had a relatively cosmopolitan education/upbringing and believed people of all states needed to band together. Their regional affiliations didn't necessarily bleed onto their mission.\n\n1. While I agree there's a lot of graft and corruption in the Indian Bureaucracy and Political System, India has done well since independence, particularly in the last two decades. How can I say this? Well, GDP per capita has risen from $1100 in 1990 to $6570 in 2016. Here's the source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=IN\n\n1. You mention India has a Billion people (1.324 Billion) and then complain about education for everyone. You do realize that's a LOT of people right. It'll take decades for primary education to reach them all. Some states are doing it better than others (Kerala for example). It just requires political will.\n\n1. You talk about our GDP numbers like they're a smokescreen. It's not. India is one of the largest economies in the world and while our GDP per capita isn't equal to that of western nations and other Asian countries, it also means we have tremendous potential for growth. Something other countries are struggling with. I hate people comparing us with the US and other European countries. We're literally one of the youngest countries in the world! How well do you think the US was doing in 1860?\n\n1. Democracy is supposed to mean every person has a single vote. It has its flaws, but it is the fairest form of governance. At the end of the day, an imperfect system is better than an oppressive one. And give Indians the credit they deserve. Modi was voted in to bring economic reform. People voted for him because they wanted better lives for their kids. Vote bank politics is dying, slowly but surely. \n\n\nFinally, I'd like to say, I know your intentions are very noble here. But it's easy to sit back and complain and bitch about the country. It's harder to roll up your sleeves and work for the nation. I'm not saying you don't do that, but r/india is a great resource to discuss this. There are many educated and diverse opinions here. Eventually, the unkills will leave the country behind for us. Let's not become like them and die saying Sare Jahan se accha Hindustan hamara and then having their kids move abroad.  Add a TLDR please..and I don't know what you are trying to get at.. and how you arrived on answer of union of states, from tax. \n\nEating tax of a billion people.?? Which tax are we talking about? The number income tax payers is < 3 %\n\n >Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation.\n\nThis nationalism is a very modern concept. We been cosmopolitan from early ages itself. And cherished the subcontinent or peninsula more like a single entity of similar culture. \n\nFor example Sankaracharya from extreme south established four temples at the four corners of modern India at an ancient time where nationalism wasn't upfront. Ujjain has remained the astronomical center for many of Indian calenders, irrespective of kingdoms. \n\nThere is a reason for our extreme population, the land has been sought out by people from all over for fertile pastures and wealth, and those who came here settled. And diversity was inherent of land that shaped its culture, unlike other countries where ethnic groups clustered together. While in America every differences get melted into single stream, here people welcomed the diversity, and it still says that way. \n\nAlso if European population hasn't moved out to their colonies, they would have been faced with this population problem as ours, am sure. > Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans\n\nNope. Sinhala people are Indo Aryan. They are more closer to Bengalis and Biharis than Tamilians. Your argument is trying to make India out to be a special snowflake.\n\nJust look up the history of the **US of A** or **Germany.**\n\nIndia's circumstances are not unique or new. These guys will give you the same old bullshit man that's the problem. Fuckers will still tell you about mother india being rich and wealthy centuries ago. We gave the world zero blah blah fucking blah. India is tragic as fuck, the talent and the potential is out of this world but the majority of the people are absolute fucking filth when it comes to mentality. Materialistic, show off, jealous, blinded by religion. Anything for the rupee, will literally sell their own mothers for money. They consider the ability to have maids and slaves as a fucking wow factor of living in India in 2017........all the butthurts are going to down vote this to death. 2 or 3 percent of people won't be like this. Biggest tragedy was the goras leaving. But OP is right though.....no unity at all. Which is one reason I love watching the Indian cricket team at least I feel like there is some unity, that and probably the defense forces. General public bheinchod tamasha dekhne ke liye paida hui hai. Bollywood, Ekta Kapoor, Politics, Babas.....so much chutiyappa. What you basically want is a federal structure, and you'd be surprised to know that the concepts of federalism is already there in the constitution. There are topics which are the state govt's prerogative and the central govt. can't interfere, and there are topics where the opposite is true. It's the reason why we have state governments at all in addition to having central governments. Federalism is something our founding fathers believed in, all it needs is to be strengthened and properly observed. I don't think your idea of completely splitting the country apart into smaller nations is viable. If nothing else, surely you believe that having a single unified military and financial structure is more beneficial than having dozens of them?\n\n>A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy.\n\nThe point of democracy is that every citizen has an equal vote share by the virtue of being a citizen, not by the virtue of how productive they are or how educated. If you spend a few minutes pondering on what you wrote, you'd realize how unfair your proposed system would be and how quickly it'll lead to tyranny, by a group if not by an individual.\n\n>When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power.\n\nWhich is still better than not caring about votes at all and just shoving a gun at people's faces and telling them to do this and that. Again, while nobody says democracy is perfect, you'd realize it's still better than all the alternatives. Enlightened dictatorships only happen in fictions. This feels like a bad idea. Our \"confideracy\" of states will get chewed out by China. Besides.. being part of the same country is beneficial. Look at the water disputed between Karnataka and TN. Things would be a lot worse.

My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.\n\nThe anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. \n\nI was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. \n\nNowadays for me a \"good day\" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called \"happiness\" it's just a myth in my opinion. \n\nI even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. \n\nWhy is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, \"ohh what if I die single\" \"ohh why I'm a nice guy\" \"ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single\" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. \n\nPre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is \"relationship goals\" why is my generation so much into this \"my soul mate\" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a \"shoulder to cry on\" \"another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day\" more interested in \"opposite gender\" if you don't have any \"opposite gender bestie\" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a \"significant other\" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth \"dating\". \n\nAnd what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start \"liking\" the other person then you \"propose\" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start \"seeing\" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being \"girlfriend/boyfriend\".\n\nI'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? \n\nI've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.\n\n1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.\n\n2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.\n\n3) I'll try \"pleasure-mastery\" therapy.\n....\n\nWill add if you guys advice something worth it.",

Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   \n\n2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   \n\n3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   \n\n4. Discover a new outlook towards life. \n\n5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   \n\n\n**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**\n\n**You Go out there and Kill it**\n\nAll the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.\n\n\nThe first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)\n\nIt was nice.\n\n\nBut my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.\n\n\nAfter a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.\n\n\nDid you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.\n\n\nPerhaps, [the book of life](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos) will cheer you up.\n\n\n[Bonus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R8NNLQbQNU&index=5&list=PLl_W0XfWWijadr1pMob0RFJIS1-EI9p_E)\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nDon't watch [\\(500\\) Days of Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfMaE0KFNpU).",

How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.\n\nI understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. \n\nBJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.\n\nI understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. \n\nAnyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?\n\nIndia already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.\n\nThis is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.\n\nEDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.\n",

    "comment" : " Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. \n\nISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.\n\nTo develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.\n\nThere are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.\n\n [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  \n\nBecause they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. \n\nFTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. \n >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated\n\nParty before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.\n\nPeople say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. \n  how is FTII and institution of national importance?\n\nSecond question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?\n\nYou have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front. \n\nStudents, dalits, farmers... UPA master plan",

    "body" : "Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.\n\nHowever, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?\n\n**Indicators of Concern**\n\n*Employability*\n\nThe National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. \n\nThe report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. \n\nThe go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. \n\n*Output*\n\nThe other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. \n\nThe SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. \n\nAccording to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). \n\nWe see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.\n\n**A Chain of Causes**\n\n*Postgraduate Education*\n\nResearch output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. \n\nAt the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. \n\nThis data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. \nThe AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. \n\n*Throttled Funds*\n\nThe dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. \nInternational Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%\n. \n\n*Teacher Numbers*\n\nAbove, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. \n\nTwo other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.\n\nUsing general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. \n\nWith better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThe lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.\t[“National Employability Report - Engineers Annual Report 2015” – Aspiring Minds](http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%202015_0.pdf)\n\n2.\t[All India Survey on Higher Education (2013-14), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India](http://aishe.nic.in/aishe/viewDocument.action?documentId=196)\n\n3.\t[AICTE Statistics Dashboard:\nFigures for year 2014-15, Engineering and Technology Institutions](http://www.aicte-india.org/dashboard/pages/dashboard.php?year=2&institutiontype=1&level=1&program=Engineering+and+Technology&state=1&Minority=1&Women=1&dashboard=)\n\n4.\t[SEVIS By The Numbers, August 2015:\nStudent Exchange and Visitor Program, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report/2015/sevis_bythenumbers_aug15.pdf)\n\n5.\t[SCImago Journal & Country Rank](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=2200&category=0&region=all&year=all&order=cd&min=1000&min_type=it)\n\n6.\t[OECD – Science Technology and Industry Outlook 2014: Country Profiles – Comparative performance of national innovation systems – Indexes](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MSTI_PUB)\n\n7.\t[International Comparative Study: Engineering Education in India\nSouth Asia Human Development Sector, World Bank](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/04/17844321/international-comparative-study-engineering-education-india)\n\n8.\t[National Science Board Science & Engineering Indicators 2016\nChapter 4, Table 4-4](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsb20161/uploads/1/7/tt04-04.pdf)\n\n",

In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. \n\nAnecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.\n\nIMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those \"guides\" are so bad it's not even funny. \n\nThis problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the \"book\".  Very well written!\n\nIMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,\n\n> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.\n\nFrom the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.\n\nNow one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.\n\nNow without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. \n\nWe need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.\n\n**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the \"engineering\" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article\n",

    "body" : "**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  \n\nNGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).\n\nThere have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.\n\nThe problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of \"filling the gaps in services\" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.\n\nThe first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.\n\nThis American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... \"jasoosi kar raha hai kya?\" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: \"Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.\"\n\nAnd indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.\n\nIt wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.\n\nThe point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the \"greater good\", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.\n\nOne can almost understand the appetite for these sort of \"arrangements\" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.\n\nThe NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.\n\nSo now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?\n\nThe second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.\n\nMike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.\n\nThe solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.\n\nOver 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.\n\nWhat could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!\n\nA very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as \"fascist\" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.\n\nCan we begin to imagine a time when the \"marginalized\" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept \"marginalized\" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",

A superconductor is one which conducts electricity with zero resistance to the flow of electrons. \n\nand \n\n\\> Clarifying about the zero voltage Prof. Ghosh said, “At temperatures slightly below 161.3 K the voltage is zero up to 10 milliampere current. The voltage may increase at higher current, which was not tested. Similar behaviour was observed in metal whiskers where superconductivity is observed at a lower temperature. If this is true, why the hell are we publicizing the research??\n\nThis has incredible applications, and the strategic advantages must not be squandered.

And then they complain about brain drain I want to bring the children of India towards science. This is the only way to kill pseudoscience and superstitions.  I wish I had enough money to start a project that takes scientific education to every part of India.  This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?\n\nIs this just another jumla to win more elections?\n\nDon't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?\n\nAre they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?\n\nAmbani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.\n\nNor can the Sangh.\n\nCan't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?\n\nWhat's the 20 year game plan of Shah?\n\nWinning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?\n\nA feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.\n\nModi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.\n\nBut what's with the Sangh and Shah?\n\nThe Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.\n\nI don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.\n\nBut I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?\n\nDoesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?\n\nHe has to understand economics really well, right?\n\nDisposable incomes and all that.\n\nWhat's the Sangh's endgame?\n\nWith Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.\n\nWith this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.\n\nThere's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, \"China is bad\" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.\n\nKuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?\n\nI can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.\n\nThey're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. \n\nWho does that level of stupidity?\n\nThey are the house and they are gambling as if they need to win desperately. What gives?\n\nAre they sure that they will not win more than once?\n\nIs this all a 10 year con with their full knowledge that they cannot get a 3rd term?\n\nIf this is a 10 year con, which country are they going to flee to?\n\nI just don't get it.\n\nEven poor saps like me invest in insurance and pensions to make savings for 30 years down the future. \n\nWhy isn't the BJP doing this?",

But, this article feels more like Sheldon Cooper making Physicist master race arguement, that surprisingly ends in a compulsive suggestion on the very applied science it has been bashing . India ? Sure a country with more than 1 billion human beings don't know the difference between tech and science because some idiotic article said so.   **India still doesn’t know the difference between tech & science** and that's why A P J Abdul Kalam is considered by all and sundry to be a scientist.

Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest. Either way I'm gonna die, even if I get a job and earn money or not. Should I  run away from the college when the break starts so that nobody knows? I wish I die tonight in my sleep.

I believe if you have invested a substantial amount of time and money in engineering, you should at least get a degree in it. After the degree you can do MS in Mathematics  or even become a math teacher if you would like.

You can still move to pure sciences, lot of people have done it. For example, if you are in CS/IT, you can go for a masters in Statistics or Applied mathematics or Financial mathematics. All have good scope. Stats or applied maths will get you a great career in data science. Financial mathematics can get you a career in HFT firms or others as Quantitative Analyst but it’s tough to get into, you have to be really good at your maths.\n\nIf you are in other branches also, these fields are open. Applied physics is also good for niche careers especially if you have mech background.\n\nThe whole point is, there’s always something if you don’t give up. Your parents can provide you direction.

Quite a lot of scientists indulge in petty corruption and a ,ajor requirement is to be a brown noser and not a good scientist if you want to advance your career. If the government demanded a result oriented approach these guys probably failed to deliver and will continue to fail to deliver (although admittedly doing research like that is also not quite possible.) >Recently, CSIR’s Director-General Girish Sahni claimed that most of CSIR’s patents were “bio-data patents”, filed solely to enhance the value of a scientist’s resume and that the extensive expenditure of public funds spent in filing and maintaining patents was unviable. CSIR claims to have licensed a percentage of its patents, but has so far failed to show any revenue earned from the licences.\n\n[Source] (http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-compulsive-patent-hoarding-disorder/article17617888.ece) \n\nCSIR had it coming.

You don't see them begging for funds because they have successfully managed their organisation. And the government doesn't interfere. \n\nI will be glad if government stop pouring taxpayers money into those other money sucking black holes like Air India, BSNL etc. \n\n Why would Modiji give a shit about scientific research and development when he has a full fledged ayush ministry?  Jackass and his govt spends thousands of crores on mindless statues and TV, print, youtube ads, but somehow ran out of money for CSIR? Fucking imbeciles.

Andha paisa hai? >1) Which is the earliest session he can target? (R3/R4 deadlines seem to have gone by)\n\nEarliest season deadlines are in August/September.

But, At least 700+ for Indian men.\n\n>4) Can appearing multiple times for GMAT have repurcussions? (except the ones incurred by pocket)\n\nNo. Most schools take highest score.\n\n>5) What is lumpsum figure for fee (can he can expect to be offered scholarship based on GMAT score)\n\nTuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years. Likelihood of scholarship in top 20 schools is very low based on your profile. If you go below top 20 schools, you may get a scholarship based on GMAT, but you may not get a job.\n\n>6) He is a merchandiser and has been in this industry for 3 years. He has worked for one start up also(pretty crucial role), can leaving his current job for 2-3 months for preparation have negative impact? (in terms of Recommendation letter, Work experience etc.)\n\nDepends on the rapport with the person who will give recommendation letter. Small gaps won't likely have huge impact on application. But three years of overall experience is very low for US b-schools where the median is 5 years and for Indian applicants, it's likely around 7-8 years.\n\n\n>7) How to not suck at SOP and Essay Writing? (We have no idea except what google told us on how to proceed with this)\n\nUse someone who has done this to review your essays and give you input.\n\n**In addition to the questions above, read up about H1-B visas. With an MBA, you only get one chance at H1-B lottery (chance of getting one is around 30%-40%). If you don't get it, you have to leave the US** Honestly India is getting as expensive as US for MBA. The quality is also not that bad. We have ISB, and IIMs.... Why not try for those ?\n\nUS is a tough decision these days, what with the H1B rejections going on.",

There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results.

We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it?

First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions\ncan never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level\nintellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of\nthe ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership\nto huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot\nbe the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the\nsecond- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of\nthis is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society.

In turn, our society responds to this elitism by\nundervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.\n\nThere have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed\nthe twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in\nscience and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native\nlanguage for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their\nprincipal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best\nGerman labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in\nEnglish, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists\nhave to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific\nsubjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has\nchosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its\nlocal languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.\n\nWhenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against\nuniversity education in one’s native language. The first is that English is\nnecessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish\nEnglish, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The\nsecond argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is\nboth a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever\nmakes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both\ndysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is\nentirely feasible with focus and investment.\n\nWhat, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in\nscience and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-\nschool education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus\naccessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,\neducation is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as\ntranslations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya\nVidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the\ntraining of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught\nin both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,\nbut its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in\neither language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be\nsteadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in\ncollege and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,\nin STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional\neducation, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course\nassist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.\n\nOur international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.\nWithout losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about\ncomplex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can\ncome only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their\nminds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in\nwhich the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use\nof English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of\nlanguage as the basis for the power of ideas.\n\n**_K VijayRaghavan is secretary, department of biotechnology, ministry of science and technology, and former director of The National Centre for Biological Sciences_**\n\n**_The views expressed are personal_**\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

A\nmemorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India’s first\nLithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR’s Central\nElectro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI\nSolar Power Pvt Ltd.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology\nof Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr\nGopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)\nNew Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)\nKolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.\n\n“CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype\nLithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost\nreduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology\nfor mass production,” a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.\n\n**ALSO READ| TATA launches India-made portable MRI scanner**\n\nAt present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for\nimport of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150\nmillion in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.\n\nSpeaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister\nHarsh Vardhan said: “Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities\nof CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support\nour industry, besides other sectors.”\n\n**ALSO READ| Chinese smartphone maker to locally source this crucial component**\n\nThe indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime\nMinister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean\nenergy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.\n\n“It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by\ngenerating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and\nthe second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to\nelectric vehicles by 2030,” said Harsh Vardhan.\n\nThe project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi’s vision of “Make\nin India” to turn the country into ” a manufacturing hub and to cut down\noutflow of foreign exchange.”\n\n**ALSO READ| Dhanush, India’s first indigenous long-range artillery gun**\n\nAs per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil\nNadu’s Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to\nbring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace\nthe Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for\nsolar rooftop with life span of 25 years.\n\n“We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per\nKW to replace Lead Acid Battery…“We also have plans to make Lithium Ion\nbattery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable\nenough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,” Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing\nDirector C Narsimhan said.\n\nWhy Lithium-Ion batteries:\n\nLi-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid\nto container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles\n(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid\nStorage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and\nOffice Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.\n\nLithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of\nphysical wires-means wireless.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

    "comment" : " It boils down to the high expectations parents force on their wards. Often times it is about projecting their shortcomings on their children - 'Hey I wasn't able to crack this engineering\\medicine course, I hope my child does it' So even without understanding what their child wants they go about forcing them to become who they were unable to be!\n\nAlthough I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.\n\nEven though US follows the Prussian model, they give a whole variety of other things for the child to choose from to help him/her identify their core competency. This is lacking in India though - athough there's a marked change recently albeit only for those who can afford it. The rest, as you pointed out, go through the 'industrial belt process' and come out as packaged cans unable to apply their minds critically let alone use what's stuffed inside! tldr: [Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) That post is really a gem of a discovery OP!\n\nWhat the post is suggesting is somewhat similar to Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan Academy isn't it? I once an interview with Amartya Sen about how the eclectic environment of Shantiniketan shaped his mind, I've always been interested in the model of 'open', 'interest based' learning. Yes, some things are necessary and have to be compulsory - such as arithmetic and language, even if children are not interested in them.\n\nBut all other disciplines should be learned in a sort of mixed way. For example, why separate History and Literature? Why not study the great texts of the past to study about past society and learn the intricacies of great literature? I've always thought this would be an interesting approach. One could do the same for geography, learn stories from different places, then discuss the environment in which they take place.\n\nScience should be more story based too, linked into history and literature, about how human discovered more and more about the world, leading to scientific revolution and the world of today.\n\nAll this can only happen when school occurs in a more relaxed atmosphere. I like the idea of not having rows, perhaps we should have more garden based learning, something like the Ashramas of old, with lessons and sport intermixing, with perhaps theatre and dance, singing, etc.\n\nAll this sounds too utopian, but maybe schools can start by designating one month for such kind of learning and see the results. Education needs reform though, even the most radical ideas should not be rejected out of hand. Wait the answer is not track all students using aadhar? /s Finlands made great strides in this area, look for talks by pasi sahlberg. I do not think reform is needed.\nWe just require better teachers.  > One way India could reform **it's** education \n\nAssuming this wasn't just autocorrect at work:\n\nhttp://www.grammar-monster.com/easily_confused/its_its.htm",

[deleted] \"Lund\" is ahead of IISc. :D Fuck yeah\n\nPS - Always take these rankings with a pinch of salt. They are very much anglo-saxon oriented and each of them use different metrics. \nFor e.g. - If you consider Munich or Berlin or Zürich, they in the Germanic tradition separate universities of basic learning and universities of technology, which the UK and US mostly don't. All of their big unis do research in and teach all disciplines. But say for .e.g in IISc or at the University of Munich, you don't do technology. That's the domain of the technical universities (Technische Hochschulen or Technische Universitäten). If you club them together, then Munich and Berlin would rank in the top 25 based on pure research output and impact. But most of these rankings also consider things like the ratio of international students and gender equality and social impact etc. \n\nIf you want to do a good intensive Master's programme and then a PhD, choose a smaller university. The instructors are more hands-on. I studied at the Uni of Munich and except 2 professors, all the other big guys sent in their post-docs to teach. A friend of mine did her MSc in Neuroscience at the Uni of Edinburgh, and it was just 1 year and just 3 months of thesis. They hardly learnt anything general; it was way too focussed on a few particular topics. And in the same way, choose a doctoral advisor (PI) who is an up and coming star instead of a well-established professor, because the younger guy will be more hands-on because he is in line for big grants and a future Chair at a big Uni.  There was another ranking a few weeks back where the IITs were ranked at 600 right? So is this another ranking? Thanks in advance for clarifying.

    "comment" : " No pls.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** \n\n ______ \n** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **\n\nThe recent suggestion by\n\nRV Deshpande\n\n, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure\ndevelopment, that\n\nBengaluru\n\nbe given the status of a second capital of\n\nIndia\n\nhas sparked off an interesting debate.\n\nFor a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a\ncompelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that\nDeshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.\n\nThe concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across\nthe world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the\nNetherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals — Bloemfontein,\nCape Town, and Pretoria — that house its judicial, legislative and executive\nbranches.\n\nBengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status\nas the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our\nscientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.\n\nBengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs\nto invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,\nindustry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of\nthe S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,\nworld-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.\n\nThe information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong\nentrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the \"Science\nCapital\", \"Startup Capital\", \"IT Capital\" and \"Biotechnology Capital\" of the\ncountry.\n\nBy proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the\nadministrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to\nhave a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi\nand Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's\nKnowledge Capital.\n\nThe city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the\nevolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India\nto leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for\nimplementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related\nministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit\nimmensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the\ngovernment in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.\n\nThe success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the\nDepartment of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of\nscience &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in\nBengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can\nlead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique\nIdentification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can\nbenefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the\ncity as the data science hub of the country.\n\nAs India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India\ntowards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and\nparticipatory policy-making through the government's\n\nDigital India\n\ninitiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a\nredress of issues and policymaking.\n\nAs a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden\nof governance through greater expediency and efficiency.\n\nBy giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the\nIndian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative\nS&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a\nvery integral part of the country.\n\n_The writer is CMD, Biocon, and president, Bangalore Political Action\nCommittee_\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

This is what happens when the director is [appointed by the government](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/take-lessons-ancient-sages-they-were-probably-great-scientists-manohar-parrikar-tells-drdo-647834).

Last year they harping about [intel gathering in the vedas](http://www.dailyo.in/politics/how-the-drdo-is-riding-the-saffron-chariot-to-please-modi/story/1/1238.html), and before that they wanted to [hire this idiot](http://swamykujrananda.blogspot.in/2010/05/fast-yogi-how-stupid-is-media.html), to train soldiers to survive without food and water. Why DRDO? Why? Why do you have to be like this? Look at your brother over there. Why can't you be more like him? Such a waste of DRDO resources.

    "comment" : " Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.\n\nAnyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.\n\nWhile I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).\n\nSo no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be \"Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West\".\n\nThis is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.\n\nRegardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.\n\n>\"There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,\" he said. \"A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.\"\n\n>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.\n\n>\"There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,\" he admits.\n\nI think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.\n\nI think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. \n\n>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today\n\nThe researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. \n\n V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. \n\nAnyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled.",

    "comment" : " **Improving India’s scientific capabilities**\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2017/01/13/Photos/Opinion/ed-kuIB--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)\n\n___\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi’s pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030—announced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week—is a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.\n\nIndia has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world’s most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions—but that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.\n\nOnly time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government’s plans and priorities.\n\nFirst is the government’s focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.\n\nA human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.\n\nThe situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.\n\nThe second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.\n\nAnother example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government’s flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series—and can be seen as part of the government’s larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself—as Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize—will not be enough.\n\nDo you think India can become a science and technology powerhouse in the near future?

Why does it matter. \n\n>\"Our saints had said that earth existed 1.96 arab (billion) years ago. Earlier, science did not accept this but later it had to. What they tell is run by our channels. They should have asked Pundits,\" he said praising ancient Indian knowledge.\n\nJust a simple google search shows that the age of Earth is ~4.5 billion years old. That's why science didn't accept it. Do speechwriters even fact check?\n\n>Stating that no other country possesses the knowledge, which India has, Rajnath Singh said be it theorems of trigonometry, algebra or others no other country could match our knowledge.\n\nI think anyone with a math textbook can match our knowledge. It's not some closely guarded secret. If he's talking about historically, then it's out of my area of knowledge. \n\n>\"When knowledge is cut-off from traditional values, it becomes disastrous. Civilizations which get cut-off from their traditions and values do not survive for long. It was India which showed a big heart and gave message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family),\" he said.\n\nUhh what? I think history has shown that, people who stick to their \"traditions\" instead of adapting to a changing world, are the ones who die out. \n\n>Objecting to \"hi and bye culture\", the minister asked students not to indulge in it and instead follow traditions and touch feet of their parents and elders.\n\n>\"Today, youths say 'hi and bye' even to their parents. Instead, they should touch parents' feet as a mark of respect,\" Singh said, adding that \"Jo jhukna nahi jaante, woh toot jaate hain\".\n\nLOL. \n\nIf I had to listen to this sanctimonious bullshit on my graduation day then I would seriously annoyed. Reads like a love letter to a kulcha warrior. This is worse than the last graduation I went to when I had to hear Sashi Tharoor bloviate about his foreign trips and people he met.  everyone please join the anti right circlejerk thread, let us all bash the chaddis. \n\nno /s Actually our vedas and culture contain all knowlez about everything in the universe. The west stole everything and looted the sone ki chidiya that was once bharat. They not only looted this knowlez but also our wealth and make peoples suffer.  I feel like banging my head on the wall right now. >they will open the 'Panchang' (Hindu calendar) and tell you the dates of eclipse 100 year ago and also 100 years hence\n\nWell... Isn't that true? I thought the Hindu calendar had accurately calculated eclipse dates?\n\nAlso, I'm having trouble finding the direct quote where he says that \"An Indian pundit know more about lunar and solar eclipses than any US observatory\"\n\nI just want to exercise a little caution before jumping on the \"ZOMG V INVANT\" bandwagon And this guy has a Masters in Physics *sigh*",

A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  \n\n \n\n  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  \n\n \n\n  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of \"institutions\" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  \n\n \n\n  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the \"creative class\" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. \"Creative class\", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  \n\n \n\n  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  \n\n \n\n  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  \n\n \n\n  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  \n\n \n\n  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  \n\n \n\n  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's \"Creative Class\". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  \n\n \n\n  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  \n\n \n\n  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  \n\n \n\n  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  \n\n \n\n  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.  \n\n \n\n (Amit Kapoor is Chair, Institute for Competitiveness, India.

Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,\" Modi said.\n**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.\n\nWe'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...\n\nOn the administrative policy aspect\n\n> \"As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,\" Modi said.\n\nand\n\n>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**\n\n(Awesome!)\n\nand\n\n>\"We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,\" he added.\n\n... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)\n\nMoving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says\n\n>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, \"Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.\"\n\n&\n \n>\"You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,\" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated \"as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas\".\n\"We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nA re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.\n\nModi on the legislative policy aspect.\n\n>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.\n\nThere are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?\n\nThe PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects\n\n>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.\n\n&\n\n>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.\n\n&\n\n> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**\n\n(Are you listening, industry?)\n\n>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.\n\nThe usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.\n\nAnyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.\n\n>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.\nHe said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.\nThe PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.\n\n------\n\nPS - Yes, I know I pretty much copied that entire article here, but it was to split the points made under the relevant headings, and facilitate specific discussions along those lines. Now, discuss. Dinanath Batra ko sanyaas lene kaho. That is when this dream of yours would be fulfilled. Tell that to smriti irani Sir, your HRD minister is laughing.

While his MHRD fat zero is busy killing precisely that by behaving shamefully towards IIT directors that don't toe her line.",

It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.\n \nThe topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).\n\nI am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.\n\nI would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this.

Learning Hadoop is *Learning a technology* while learning Distributed Computing/Architecture is learning a science/concept. Why am I stressed on making the distinction? Science/concepts remains but technologies change. It's easier to switch between technologies if you know the science. Vice-versa is possible but difficult.\n\nSince you started the Intro to Data Science on Coursera; Bill Howes from University of Washington (instructor) stressed on this aspect too. Which city are you from? We have a Hyderabad Data Science group (google search for details), I think there is a similar one in Bangalore. No clue about other cities. If you can follow a degree on machine learning, data mining or statistics ( or mathematics ) you would be suited for big data analytics. To be honest, I donot have any knowledge of industry certification; most of my knowledge is from academia. \nIn academia, analysis of extremely large data sets , like Facebook, has been studied for some time.  Why did you stop the class last time? And also are you currently employed? Cos Coursera is offering Data Science specialisation and it costs approx 30K. If you can spend weekly 5-6 hours for each 3 courses, you can finish this specialisation within 6-7 months. All the best!\n\nEven I am interested in data and classes commence from April 7th. Enrolled into 3 courses as of now. Paid $150.  screw most of the advice here, so far.\n\nJust do statistics,statistics and more statistics.  At least upto t-tests, F scores.  \n\nDo not worry about hadoop.  Know your stats and numbers; they'll be enough AP guys to code for you in hadoop.\n\nMaths, you either get it or you don't.\n\nwithout going into details i take 'care' of this area where i used to work.  This thread needs to be relabelled: I heard there is more money in big data. I don't care about the field, just the certificate and a job to fuck up.\n",

He tried to maintain state control over R&D. Which resulted in mostly failure. The only Institution that succeeded was ISRO, and to a certain extent DRDO. All the other institutions became assembly plants for imported technology. Another point to note is that, early on there was more stress on humanities and literature, rather than science and technology. The focus on Science and Tech only came after Rajeev Gandhi's time. But again resulted in massive brain drain, as the Indian markets were too closed to allow for any kind of innovation.\n\nPS: This is more of a policy discussion rather than political discussion.",

Coming from a leading science and technology institute in the country, I would like to add few more things on the topic. There is a Professor in my department, who, despite his excellent career record of over 20+ years, with number of publications and supervision of doctoral studies in his kitty, still remains an \"assistant professor\" due to internal politics! Extraordinarily brilliant research scholars are rotting away their lives in dingy labs even after the stipulated 5 year time frame for PhD studies, sometimes due to department policy that sets a limit to the number of PhDs that can be awarded in an academic year, but more often due to Profs not wanting to let go of the hardworking youngsters who churn out 4 to 5 technical papers every year! There are many PhD scholars who are married, have kids and dependent parents. Bureaucracy is oblivious to their struggle to make ends meet with the meagre 18000 stipend they get every month! Lack of funding and collaboration with industries cripple the situation even more. A certain Professor, when made head of division, cut off all industrial collaboration and consultancy works that used to fetch a neat income to the department on account of \"trust deficit\". Apparently he was under the impression that these collaborators may put to use the expertise gained from the institute to terrorist activities! This is the pathetic situation of Science and Technology research in India. How can research be expected to thrive in such a discouraging environment when people have plenty of lucrative career options available at home and abroad!  Aiming for the sky when there are people that still don't have basic necessities. Congress Government had its priorities wrong from the start. Need to improve standard of living first.

If there is just a two-hour power cut in these cities, the generator sets alone generate 1 tonne of particulate matter.”\n> \n> Kejriwal also thanked the Centre for its role in building the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways, which has reduced the number of trucks entering Delhi. Environment compensation charge being levied on trucks entering Delhi also acted as a deterrent, he said. “A report shows that because of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, truck traffic has reduced by 30% and pollution has gone down by 7%.”\n> \n> Among other factors that contributed to the reduction in pollution was the decrease in dust emanating from construction sites; large-scale plantation of trees; shutting down of two thermal power stations; and increase in forest cover, the CM said. The coming winter will tell the real story. Kejri is a good man. This makes me really happy. Keep up the good work delhi folks. Isn't the pollution down by 25% because of the monsoon? So everyone except Modiji has achievements of their own. Cool. I wish kejriwal has shown the same tact when he got into power . Playing politics with center is detrimental to the people of the state . He could have achieved lot more if he did not join hands with all the corrupt parties like Congress , Rjd ,etc Toh iss saal patake bajein ya nahi? Thank you honorable Prime Minister Modi Ji.",

The party died long back and it should be given burial.\n\nWhat BJP does hardly infuriates me. I hate their ideology and what it stands for. But the pusillanimity of the parties outside NDA is unacceptable. No coherence, no unity. They are just letting BJP run away with everything. The country deserves better not these spineless idiots. His argument makes sense, as long as one carefully distinguishes 'the right thing to do' from ' the politically expedient thing to do'.  \n\nIt *is* political suicide for the INC to stand against something that a majority of the country would oppose. That would just allow the BJP to cast the INC as \"muslim loving\" , \"traitors to India\" etc, and that would find traction among large swathes of the population.\n\nWhat the majority believe, especially in  an education/thinking challenged polity like ours, is not necessarily correct. But this is too subtle a challenge for the INC to overcome as it stands today, battered and ramshackle and bereft of effective leadership. Excellent. I await the day that the BJP and their supporters point to an empty congress bench and yell \"THEY DID IT\" or \"THEY DID IT FIRST\".\n\nIn case people forget - the congress won its previous elections as members of a coalition, but they still got something like 20% of the total votes. Naice exit strategy. Congress Stand in Rajya Sabha is primarily because of Ghulam Nabi Azad being the leader of opposition. He is from Kashmir. Going by the glee shown by Congress leaders or workers elsewhere, it’s clear that they are in favour of the bill as they still harbour hopes of getting the Hindu vote. I bet that the MP would join BJP very soon. https://twitter.com/brijeshkalappa/status/1158390992606654464\n\nthis basically explains congress of today. Everyone supporting this bill are cheering cause they are not sitting in kashmir right now? There's a reason there are So many troops in kashmir and why curfew has been imposed and wifi has been put off: but these aren't permanent. This is going to aggrevate the opposition in kashmir and a civil war may occur ( I pray it won't). It is easy to cheer when you are not at risk. This is setting a very dangerous precedent and whilst I agree smth had to be done, people's lives have to be taken into account, and frankly I don't think they have been. At least some people in the congress still have some brains. https://twitter.com/milinddeora/status/1158405693067558912?s=19\nHopefully the leaders of the congress in the lok sabha do a better job tomorrow.

All you have to do to make your wish come true is to know about your own line of work, and read about the topics you're interested in. For example, I'm a medical professional and I have responded to a couple of related posts, and since I like the posts related to politics too, I read up on the topic before responding. It's about how badly you want to know the topic, not about how much you already know Firstly don't club everyone into one ultra smart person. A highly upvoted post/comment will be likely from an expert and naturally it will be rare. Secondly, if you are in awe of this level of expertise in general, then it is likely you haven't got expertise of this level in any area. But you will, as you grow up. And also as you act on this awe from now itself, if you do that. Thirdly, when you start doing research or reading you will realise how much you are capable of and it's almost guaranteed you underestimate that as of now. Vastly. I literally spout bs until someone calls me out on it and then I have to read about it to not make a fool of myself any further Read more on topics you like to master. It takes years of passionately reading different voices on topic to form an informed opinion. Even a less read person can sound well informed to someone who doesn't read at all.\n\nThe point is : read. Read about stuff you like. Make time for it. Instead of knowing every little news on Internet, focus on what you want to read. \n\nWe have an information mountain at our hands, but we have to pick what kind of info we want. Don't get overwhelmed by the size of the mountain, pick the stones that you need. \n\nThat's all you need. _I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing._\n\n~Plato Read both sides of the story from many sources and then form your own opinions. Everyone has an agenda. Relatable If you start reading a good Newspaper regularly then it will help you build opinions. You think people here or anywhere online actually know what they're talking about? Oh, you innocent babe! You are good man. These days it is so easy to have an opinion. You are way above the rest of the crowd. Stay there.",

Political news absolutely generates anxiety.\n\n2- I don't use twitter, facebook, instagram. Their only goal is to keep you online as long as they can. Pretty manipulative.\n\n3- uninstall youtube app from mobile. Laptop is fine.\n\n4- Maintain youtube feed. You have to make sure that you do not watch political crap on your main logged in account. Keep it pure; only use it to watch quality content related to your hobbies / interests or light non controversial youtubers. And tell youtube to not recommend news related stuff. And obviously unsubscribe from a channel which uploads that stuff.\n\n5- If you sometime just want to watch political stuff, open that in private browsing. What this does is, your accounts don't get personalized by google, youtube. Otherwise you'll keep seeing same and same content. And you tend to click on that poisonous content because it confirms your world-view even more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day. News is not a necessary thing to survive. My life would not change a bit if I had no idea what happened in Kashmir. Developed thick skin and it definitely helps me. Don't use social media. Fuck FB, fuck Twitter, fuck news subreddits of Reddit (get an alt account without any political/country sub subbed). Fuck TV.\n\nWatch a non-political web/tv series. Read books.\n\n\nThis will go away. Take a break from all political news and anything else that keeps to distracted, but makes you wonder what the hell just happened to your time. Do this for a couple of weeks minimum, I'd  suggest a month. \n\nMay be try reading a fiction book (non-political) or spend time with any other hobby/interests you may have.\n\nYou'll be surprised by:\n\n* how not being up to date with news has close to 0 impact in your life\n* how much you enjoy other activities/hobbies\n* how you can actually change the world by talking to people instead of just reading opinions online which does nothing\n\n\nOnce your break is done and you're ready to go back, start with newspapers then may be a news app like livemint or indianexpress.com or whatever you prefer. Do not use social media as a source of news. Do not use news aggregators like inshorts, Google news. **Ignorance is Bliss -** Me(6th Sep,2019) [Avoid news.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17640820) Because it does not matter. You will still have to earn and make a living whether it is BJP or any other party. No one cares about depression in this country. That is the harsh truth. Nothing will change.",

Oh well. They treat anyone non-Gandhi like trash and then expect to win. That’s hypocritical [deleted] Congress will perish. They are doomed. The worst thing is no other regional party seems to take congress' place, we need someone competing with BJP. It's disgusting how Congress treats some of their great party workers as a Trash just because they're not \"gandhis\". They are upset that Pranab got the Bharat Ratna before Rahul Time for Congress to Die... really need better alternative. INC leaders should leave behind this petty politics and show some respect to their former members instead of worshipping Gandhis. Since those seats were empty, they could have invited me.\nThe lunch/dinner was AWESOME! Pranab da should've been the PM. Things like this don’t bring them any favors. When they need those favors, badly. \n\nEven though I don’t think Pranabda deserves Bharat Ratna because what both his terms as FM were worst economic periods for India. \n\nAnd also disagree with Bharat Ratna for Nanaji Deshmukh.",

These conversations have left a bitter taste in the mouth for me.\n\nA lot of people - people who are generally nice, kind, and reasonable - are increasingly seeing gross violations of human right as acceptable in the \"interest of the nation.\" Some things that would have been severely looked down upon if said 4-5 years ago are a part of casual conversations. Normal, well-educated people are now openly saying that it is okay to discriminate against people because of their religion. The more I think about it, the more depressed I feel about the state of things.\n\nMy question is this: how do we deal with this? This sudden shift in the general public conscience is not going to go away on its own. My personal experience has been that most attempts to counter this new line of reasoning only results in people getting defensive and deeper ingrained in their own prejudices. How do we counter this? How do we empathize with the position that these people are coming from and make them see that there is an alternative way of seeing things?",

    "comment" : " It's good that you think over these situations. Let me tell you this, it isn't new. These feelings were always there. Communalism of this kind always persisted pre independence and post independence as well. It is now in the open partly because of the information age. Growing up we are all taught this \"oh they are not like us, they are different people with different set of values\". When such thoughts are ingrained in our upbringing how do you expect habits to change by any amount of argument. These sentiments have now got a voice with political representation. Infact at many places this is the acceptable line of thought.\nI come from a place where i grew up among the elite sections of the society. My father was always introduced as \"aree ye un musalmano jaise nahi hai\". I always thought this was an acceptable line of thought. Now when i look back and think over it, i have just respect for my father. He heard it all, accepted it all just so that we get accepted by the society even though we had a different set of identity.\nIs this India of my dreams? My Incredible India is lost somewhere... my hindu friend is very vocal about how entirely incompetent our current government is. she regularly puts up stories criticising the failures of government. when she put up the stories about kashmir, though, all hell broke loose. so many people of her own family berated her. her \"friend\" said that 'you shouldn't criticise modiji, i agree that hindus are benefiting but don't criticise him'. just typing this out makes me feel physically sick. how can people be so blindly trusting of a man who time and again has fucked over the economy is simply baffling to me. at this point, i really do wish i could somehow leave india. i cannot bear to stay here any longer. The only way I see it is if the opposition gets stronger, more organised and starts speaking up for real issues or if people decide to start a revolution against the corruption that is so inbred at all levels of politics and governance. It did not shift suddenly, it's just that we hear a lot of them more thanks to technology. The situation seems to be actually improving albeit very slowly. Its not growing.  Believe it or not, its decreasing.  People everywhere are more secular, more accepting, and as they become more educated and exposed to information, the trend will only accelerate.\n\nConsider the people on reddit, for instance.  The majority are liberal.  More importantly,  even the ones who come in bigoted often quickly see the other side and change their views.\n\nPeople have been killing each other in the name of religion for centuries in India.  They have treated each other badly.  Muslims and Hindus have been at each other's throats for 500 years, as have Hindus and Christians.  It wasn't too long ago that we had the holocaust called the partition.\n\nWhat is happening is that thanks to all the free flow of information, increasingly acts of stupidity are being noted, reported on and, made public.  You get to hear more of them than in the past. These will give joy to a small number of bad people, but a greater number will be repelled and not want to be associated with it.\n\nWe do have a local uptick of bigotry, thanks to Modi and his bhakts, but Im convinced this is a short-lived bump. No trend in history is monotonic, and these people will likely *accelerate* the trend to liberalism.\nThe hindutavadis of India have made my ultra-religious bigoted parents start to change their views -- in their 70s.  They don't want to be associated with the hate.  They haven't gotten as far as I'd like them to be, but 10 years ago a muslim or christian wouldn't be allowed in their kitchen or puja room;  now the muslim driver they've \"adopted\" spends his time there. Youre not to be afforded any protection just because you belong to a particular religion is all i take it to mean.\n\nFun fact. Human rights dont exist. You get to have what others are willing to give you. Follow what society prescribes, modulate according to inner moralities, keep calm and carry on. You can't. It's too late. The government is fascist and can't take any criticism. It's not a democracy anymore. I feel bad for you Muslims in India. There's honestly no place for you in that country, and if you think there is then you're just kidding yourself. This entire Hindu supremacist movement that Modi has ignited will not go away any time soon; in fact, what you're seeing right now is the growth of it. The true sentiments of the Hindu population is starting to arise because they feel more comfortable than ever before to voice their hatred. Similar to how white supremacists view Trump. I mean, they call it HINDUstan for a reason. As long as your allegiance lies with new Delhi, do fuckall.",

    "comment" : " > What is more alarming for the Congress high command is what veterans see as the first signs of rebellion from the party’s prominent young faces — Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, Milind Deora in Maharashtra, Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Deepender Hooda in Haryana and Jitin Prasada in Uttar Pradesh, to name a few.\n\nThis is funny as the \"rebellion\" is against the \"old guard\" of the Congress. As is the democratic Congress culture, they are playing politics to assert their own place in the party. The author tries to paint it as a rebellion against the Gandhi family when the real truth is that they have the tacit support of Rahul Gandhi in this. > Deora, claim Maharashtra Congress leaders, has been “in touch” with the BJP and is preparing to jump ship. He didn’t respond to calls and text messages from ThePrint about these claims.\n\nRumour mongering. Thewebdev baksh de mujhe > These young leaders chose to go public with their dissent against the party line on Article 370 ...\n\nThe official party line is that they support the eventual repeal of Article 370 but do not support the undemocratic and unconstitutional way the current government has done it. So support for repealing Article 370 by any Congress leader is just a reiteration of the party stand and is not some \"rebellion\" against the party or the leadership. > According to experts, the inability of leaders to see a politically viable future for themselves in the party coupled with the leadership crisis since Rahul’s resignation has encouraged them to speak their minds.\n\nThis I agree with. Rahul Gandhi's resignation and the inability of the Congress leadership to address this effectively certainly has created a perception of leadership vacuum and caused morale to fall. However, they still believe only in the Gandhis to deliver on this too. First when the Gandhis were in absolute control, people had problem. Now they're losing control, people have problem. Gandhis kare to kare kya? > Scindia and Pilot have been sulking since they were denied chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan last December.\n\nI am sure they were disappointed. But again, they have no plans to leave the Congress for it and are being quite active rather than \"sulking\".\n\n> Pilot recently hit out at Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s failure to prevent the closure of the Pehlu Khan case, where the accused were acquitted. \n\nAgain, normal congress politics at work. There are many in the Congress who thinks this sensitive matter was not paid due attention by the government.\n\n> Scindia’s supporters in the party have been attacking Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior leader Digvijaya Singh and have even threatened to resign if the party’s reins are not handed over to the former Guna MP.\n\nAgain, normal Congress politics at work. **The author mistakes democratic dissent as a \"rebellion\".** > Five Congress MLAs in Maharashtra have already resigned from the party and over half-a-dozen more are negotiating with the BJP, a senior state Congress functionary told ThePrint ... There are similar reports from the other poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Haryana \n\nNothing new here. Before any election, BJP under Amit Shah is known to open its coffers and / or use state agencies to entice opposition party leaders to join it. > 10, Janpath, Sonia Gandhi’s residence, used to be the first port of call for any party chief minister visiting Delhi. One of them recently spent a couple of days in the national capital but left without even seeking an appointment with her, confided a Congress leader, blaming it on Rahul’s “condescending behaviour” with his party colleagues.\n\nDisgruntled congress worker who didn't get an appointment to meet Sonia Gandhi blames Rahul Gandhi for it. Obviously that happens a lot as the party President cannot meet everyone who desires to meet him / her and sometimes deliberately doesn't to send a message. > When Rahul Gandhi, the former party president who is likely to return to the helm sooner rather than later, was at the receiving end of the BJP for questioning normalcy in Kashmir, which Pakistan used in its petition to the United Nations, few party colleagues came out to endorse his stand.\n\nAn outright lie - even Shashi Tharoor has made a public statement endorsing Rahul Gandhi's statement and supporting him.",

If the opposition were actually serious to start a movement against this public murder of democracy by the power-that-be, they'd use this as an opportunity to identify the saboteurs and ban them from the party once and for all.\n\nWith each of these defectors joining the BJP, my respect for the opposition grows; those who still choose to stay are actually committed to their core values and believe in it even if the world goes crazy over dictators. Heading towards one nation , one party scenario 😅 Mass recruiter... Sabka messiah... Mass recruiter... Sabka messiah that's scary What's new? Politicians will sell their souls for power and if they see one side is becoming the dominant party then they will go join that party whatever conflict of interest and values be damned.\n\nOpposition in this country is fucked.

    "comment" : " That guy looks high as a kite. Lmao Saste nashe. That is how bhakts react when Bjp does something bad\n\nEdit: my first silver! Thank you my good sir! For those of you unaware about what’s going on. It’s a festival celebrated around Telangana & Andhra Pradesh(?) and named as “Bonalu”. \n\nThere’s an interesting story behind its celebration and related to pre-colonial era of long-stretched famines and droughts in the Deccan region. I wish I could tell you more but I’m not a native and know about it only from friends and experience living in Hyderabad for the past 7 years. \n\nIf you know more about it, definitely enlighten me. I would be glad. Bonalu is a Hindu Festival where Goddess Mahakali is worshiped. It is an annual festival celebrated in the twin Cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad and other parts of Telangana state, India.\n\nBonalu is celebrated usually during Ashada Masam that falls in July/August. Special poojas are performed for goddess Yellamma during the first and last day of the festival. The festival is considered as a form of thanksgiving to the Goddess after the fulfillment of vows. Bonam literally means Meal in Telugu, which is an offering to the Mother Goddess. Women folk in household prepare rice that is cooked along with Milk, Jaggery in a New Earthen or Brass Pot, which is adorned with Neem Leaves, Turmeric and Vermilion. Women carry these pots on their heads and make an offering of Bonam, including Bangles and Saree to the Mother Goddess at Temples. Bonalu involves worship of Kali in her various forms such Mysamma, Pochamma, Yellamma, Dokkalamma, Pedamma, Poleramma, Ankalamma, Maremma, Nookalamma etc.\n\nBonalu festival -Origin \nThe festival history reportedly started in 1813 in the region of Hyderabad & Secunderabad when plague disease had broken out in Twin Cities that had claimed thousands of lives. A military battalion from Hyderabad was then deployed to Ujjain and concerned about the plague menace in Hyderabad the military battalion offered prayers to Mother Goddess at Mahankaali Temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, that if people get relived from the epidemic they would be installing the idol of Mahankaali back in Secunderabad. It is believed by devotees that Mahankaali halted the spread of the disease while the Military Battalion came back here & installed an idol by offering Bonalu to Mother Mahankaali.\n\n**The Ritual** \nBonalu is celebrated across various parts of the city. During the first Sunday of Aashaadam, celebrations begin at Golconda Fort followed by Ujjaini Mahakali Temple in Secunderabad and Balkampet Yellamma temple in Balkampet on second Sunday, and the third Sunday, at the Pochamma and Katta maisamma temple near Chilkalguda and the Matheswari temple of Lal Darwaza in Old City of Hyderabad. Other temples such as Akkanna Madanna temple in Haribowli, Muthyalamma temple in Shah Ali Banda are the popular venues where Bonalu is celebrated. Lakhs of devotees throng the temples to pay obeisance to Mahankaali. \n\nWomen dress up in the traditional Sari along with jewels and other accessories during the occasion. Teenage Girls adorn Half-Sarees along with jewels to reflect the traditional grace of the attire. Some women face a spell of trace where they dance with the balancing pots to the rhythmic beats made by drums in honor of the Goddess. \n\nThe festival begins at Golconda, Women who carry Bonalu are believed to possessing the spirit of Mother Goddess, and when they approach temple, people sprinkle water on their feet in order to pacify the spirit, which is believed to be aggressive. Devotees offer Thottelu. These are small, colorful paper structures, which are supported by sticks and offered as a token of respect.\n\n**Pothuraju** \nPothuraju, considered the brother of Mother Goddess, is represented by a bare-bodied and well-built man, who wears a small tightly draped red dhoti and bells near ankles, and applies turmeric on his body, including vermilion on his forehead. Pothuraju dances to the resounding drums and dances close to Palaharam Bandi, the procession.\n\n**The Feast** \nBonalu is a festival where there is a divine offering to Mother Goddess and families also share these offerings with other family members and guests.\n\n**Rangam** \nRangam, or the Performing the Oracle, is held after the next morning of the actual festival. A Woman invokes goddess Mahankaali onto herself and performs this custom. She foretells the next year ahead when devotees ask for information about future.\n\n**Ghatam** \nGhatam implies a copper pot, which is decorated in the form of mother goddess and carried by a priest, adorning a traditional dhoti and his body completely smeared in turmeric. The Ghatam is taken as a procession from first day of the festival to the last day, when it is immersed in water. The Ghatam accompanies drums. \n\nUsually Ghatam of Akkanna Madanna Temple in Haribowli actually leads the procession, placed on an elephant inturn accompanied by mounted horses and models, which depict Akkanna and Madanna. It ends as a glittering procession in the evening after immersion of Ghatams at Nayapul. Ghatams from other popular temples of Mahakali in twin cities congregate here.\n\nhttps://telanganatourism.gov.in/partials/about/festivals-of-telangana/bonalu.html Me when I show love to my mom. u/vredditdownloader After downloading from here, it is playing in mute.\nIs everyone facing this problem This genuinely made me laugh.

Meanwhile, only 523 Asiatic Lions left\n\n[https://www.thequint.com/news/india/latest-ahmedabad-news-gir-lions-dry-spell-crop-failure-nal-sarovar-tb-consipiracy](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/latest-ahmedabad-news-gir-lions-dry-spell-crop-failure-nal-sarovar-tb-consipiracy) Perfect. > In 1972, when prime minister Indira Gandhi committed her government to bringing tigers back from the brink, her officials devised a counting method that had no basis in biology or statistics. The so-called “pugmark census” unrealistically hoped to identify every wild tiger from its paw-prints.\n> \n> That tiger census approach, which was demonstrated to be flawed by conservation scientists, suggested that tiger numbers grew to more than 4,000 by 2004. But in the following year, after two high-profile reserves claiming large tiger populations were exposed to have none at all, the pugmark census was discredited and discarded. Government officials suddenly denounced their own approach as “trash,” then unaccountably turned to an obsolete statistical method revived from the 1930s.\n> \n> Since then, three ‘national tiger estimation’ surveys have been completed (in 2006, 2010, and 2014). Each involved 90,000 man-days of labour spread over 400,000 sq km of forests and at a cost of 120m rupees (£1.2m) to Indian taxpayers. Armies of poorly trained foot soldiers collected a bewildering array of data, including tiger photos from automated camera traps, as well as counts of tiger tracks and droppings.\n> \n> The massive piles of data were then crunched through a creaky statistical model incapable of separating the ‘signal’ from the ‘noise.’ These analyses, conducted under great secrecy, have generated the government’s tiger numbers. Not available for independent replication, India’s tiger data appears to be more elusive than the cat itself.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/why-indias-tiger-census-is-misleading\n\nThis was written in 2015. Hope they've made some improvements since then - but regardless of that, comparisons are useless because the previous tiger survey is unreliable. Finally some fucking good news. Its an old joke but have they counted DADA or not? The roar is rare, keep them safe😀 Rookie numbers. You gotta pump it up. Great news! This is just beautiful!!! thats amazing",

Nagaraj took a ride in it to the Avimukteshwara temple in his hometown, Hoskote and **later went to meet CM BS Yediyurappa in his newly bought Rolls Royce.**\n\n> ... According to a report in News18, he said, *“I had a long-pending desire to purchase this car. Thankfully, it has been realised now.”* He's worth 1000 crore. It's nuts but this is peanuts for him Lucky him I guess Humble Politician Nagaraj People here are really clueless! These disqualified mla's were paid the kind of money that no one ever paid to a an elected representative in a democratic country , by the great ruling people's party bjp!

    "comment" : " Isn't it weird that Hong Kong people - despite being only 7 million strong, despite staring at an inevitable future inside an oppressive wealthy powerful giant,  despite having no prominent leadership or opposition party - still turned out in such numbers with so much determination for so long, sacrificing their normal lives and comforts. And all that for just one law that doesn't even affect most of them.\n\nIn contrast, India's institutions and laws that directly benefit citizens are falling like bowling pins one after another, but there hasn't been even one civil society protest. Civil society and civil society leadership seem nonexistent in India. A few groups are fighting via the courts, but for some strange reason, they never seem to approach people for moral or financial support. I wonder what the emergency might have felt like... I say, we keeping fighting. We must challenge, question and criticize the government on all platforms online and offline but in a manner that doesn't endanger our personal safety. It's a difficult and thankless job but I think eventually we will win. We won't be able to build a secular society in a day and it is natural to face opposition along the way. So don't lose hope, and keep fighting the good fight. Resist and keep up our narrative alive. They will get their way because they have the numbers. But as long as we keep speaking, we are doing our job. \n\nIs it enough? No. But we aren't capable of doing what is enough right now. Every nation has this boom-bust cycle even in social ideology. Imagine being born in Europe in the 1890s decade. First world war when you are 20, second one when you're 40, and if you survived, living on aid from US and UK till you die. All because the right wing extremism saw its flow. \n\nSo, we resist and wait for this flow to end and ebb to begin. I'm optimistic that we'll see the light sooner or later. Before starting a revolution against the authoritarian government, we need to revolt against the regime which is established in our own households.\n\nThe ideology to not question the higher authority and follow the orders is planted by our very own parents. Years of psychological suppression won't be so easy to overcome. I know many people who voted for BJP because their parents asked them to. I have had countless arguments with my relatives on their extremist hindu ideology but every argument ends with my parents telling me to be respectful towards my elders.\n\n\"Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country.\" \n-Franklin D. Roosevelt It's just going to be worse. In next election whether it is state / central or municipal election throw them out. 1. Change your name legally to Sharma Mishra or   Joshi Pandey or similar.\n2. Do not marry or have kids so you dont have to see loved ones suffer.\n3. Change your phone number every 6 months.\n4. Dont stay in one job or one rented place for more than a year.\n5. Take a vacation every year to the same foreign spot - be it nepal or malaysia or australia. Build connections.\n6. Apply for emigration to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA.\n7. Invest only in foreign assets either through mutual funds, NASDAQ ETF or via opening a foreign bank account and investing through it.\n8. As soon as you can, buy some property abroad ..be it nepal or USA. \n9. Dont read news, worry about politics or others. Keep your head down but discriminate against bhakts and help the underprivileged, by donating, hiring or giving them your business.\n10. Find the smallest unit of politics around you... and get involved ...local club or local walking group etc.\n11. Dont drink, smoke, gamble etc...save your money and work hard....two jobs if need be.... in 10 yrs you will have enough to leave this country. Most realistic answer after emigration: Start a business. Take risks, gather money, gain power and clout and start pushing against policies in industry forums and municipals. Let's mass emigrate out of this shit hole of a country. As an individual if we can change ourself maybe that's the revolution we need. That is the only option left  The plot of \"Watchdogs: Legion\" is starting to look very much a potential possibility.",

A leaking tap of water can waste up to 5 gallons per day, so be sure to act on it [deleted] I consider myself the luckiest: in my hometown, we get get exactly 5 days once from municipality. There is Borewell  opposite my house. Catch it? Hamare yaha toh waste karne ki pratha chalti hai. Is there anyone who has employed rain water harvesting that can be substantially used?  \n\nIn my state, houses above 3000 sqft are not given permit without rain water but it is not nearly enough to make a substantial dent in the usage by a family.

So Rahul Gandhi gave his resignation to Rahul Gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul Gandhi because Rahul Gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi rejects his decision. Enough with this nautanki. [UPDATE : Sonia Gandhi rejects resignation offer.](https://www.news18.com/amp/news/politics/rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-president-after-another-rout-sonia-gandhi-says-no-2157043.html) If I were Raga, I would not offer, I will resign with immediate effect. Go back to Amethi and stay there till UP elections. Build cadre there and ensure Congress's win in at least 10 assembly constituencies around Amethi and build some self respect. \n\nStop spreading these news through source to gain sympathy for your bootlickers to say \"no no please don't\" \nHonestly, he should resign. \n\nINC is in need of a new face, a leader who can stand up to the likes of Modi and Shah which is an extremely challenging task in itself, RaGa just isn’t capable of doing that. \n\nI don’t like Modi, but I don’t hate him either. He projected himself not only as a politician, but as a genuine leader... \n\nI feel quite sad for RaGa today, but the reality is, he just doesn’t have what it takes to be a politician..\n\n*Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, is how well they succeed at being who they are.* I think the only way INC’s dynastic hegemony will end is if they suffer successive defeats in the elections reducing their relevance. They did not learn from 2014 mandate and they will not learn from 2019. \n\nIt is ridiculous that a pan india party wins seats less than local parties. \n\nI think we will see more of the MGB style alliances forming to be a viable opposition front rather than a strong single pan india opposition party which is not optimal because you have ragtag mix of local parties without a uniform agenda that can potentially take on power at center. At this point anyone who wants RaGa to stay as head of congress is actually bjp supporters..\n\nSeriously though modi have some much to thank him. Because of RaGa today NDA have the biggest mandate since 1984!!! \n\nHow can anyone screw this badly is beyond me..any common rickshaw driver might actually be better politician than RaGa CWC won’t accept it . Mummy ko resignation dega kya Forget offering to resign. He should just do it. He has offered in the past too. It's high time the Gandhi family learn their lesson.",

    "comment" : " [deleted] National Herald is unironically calling it a [moral victory](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/amp/story/opinion%2Fnot-a-ruthless-election-machine) for RaGa. 🤦‍♂️\n\nLooks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :\n\n1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. \n\n \n\n2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  \n\n \n\n3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. \n \n\n\n4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. \n\n\n5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. \n\n\nI can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.\n\n\nEdit : Added point 5\n\n\nEdit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. \n\nIf political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.\n\n\nOne good thing about this election: dynasty politics getting obliterated.  \\-Narendra Modi finishes thanking supporters and world leaders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \\-Fully tired, slumps on a couch to rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \\-Amit Shah arrives and hands him a paper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Modi- Ye kya hai? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Amit Shah- Maharashtra aur Haryana assembly election me rallies ka schedule hai, we start tomorrow morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCopypasta from Insta, found it funny so..... Rahul's resignation rejected.\n\nWell, fuck. I believe Congress, SP, BSP etc all need fresh faces at the top. Rahul and Akhilesh bhaiyya are memes. Notice how the final results are yet to be formally declared - as of 12pm , 24th May. This is because of verifying of VVPAT slips from 5 random EVMs from each constituency. No reports of any discrepancy yet. I hope this ends the EVM discussion. Why BJP Won:   \n(Numbers from BJP President's press conference)\n\n\\- 3 Years of preparation (From January 2016)  \n\\- 3000 full time on ground workers focusing on Lok Sabha & Vidhan Sabha constituencies for the last two years  \n\\- 18 National level committees headed by senior ministers  \n\\- 29 State level committees involving 435 senior leaders.  \n\\- 482 Constituency level committees having 7,230 karyakartas in positions of responsibility  \n\\- 11 crore registered karyakartas (expanded from 2.5 crores in 2014)  \n\\- 161 Call Centers providing backup support for the last 6 months to karyakartas engaged in a campaign to reach 24 crores 81 lakh people\n\nIdeology is important.   \nSocial media reach is important.   \nArguments and rants are important.   \nBut nothing can substitute the impact of pure hard work done meticulously. I have a question. Why do people of Punjab vote for Congress and not BJP unlike other North Indian states?",

This.\n\nI hate congress and BJP both.\n\nBut I never got the unwarranted hate towards RG. (and more so, towards Kejriwal.)\n\nI get that Indian politics isn't a clean haven, but ridiculing someone's identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person, is taking to another level.\n\nI applaud RG for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera, with such calmness.\n\nAnd frankly, his recent interview with Ravish, made me realize he's wayyy better than Modi. At least, he's open to criticism and questions. honestly, whoever wins this election, Rahul Gandhi has become a commendable person in my eyes. dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out, and still act as a statesman of high order. He can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes, but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives, he may not be a great politician, but he is a great person imo. His steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring. The interview with Ravish Kumar he says \" Rahul Gandhi has to be eliminated, and I must channel the public's mandate \". That is a very deep and Zen/Upanishadic thought. All the humiliation against himself and his mother (calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute)  he took it in stride and really grew. His message is about inclusion and love. He readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn. And his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews. If youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy. \n\nOn the other hand we have the hate spewing Modi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others. I want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility? This character deficiency becomes a virtue on Modi. Strange times we live in. Not a Congress or BJP supporter (NACOBS - everyone use this acronym to save time 😋), but Modi would've gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him. I dont admire Rahul but I absolutely hate Narendra Modi.\n\nHe is a grade 1 dumbfuck They call him that because 90% of Indians love making fun of others in a very mean way. Primitive Homo Erectus culture is well and alive in India. They even make fun of IIT grad Kejri because he wears mufflers, coughs and doesn't wear suits or what not. I too lost my grandma when I was 15. She used to talk to me everyday. Still, after 3 years I still feel like she's been talking to me every evening over the phone. There might be about 99 things wrong with Rahul Gandhi but his Never Give Up attitude is worth noting. Tbh I found Priyanka Gandhi's speeches much more compelling.",

    "comment" : " he (it is pretty clear that people are voting for him rather than their local candidate) is getting more than 50% of the votes in a lot of areas. that alone is kind of amazing. would be interesting to see the final vote share. it was around 32% last year iirc. It is really significant for Rahul Gandhi, even more so actually.\n\nEasily the worst opposition leader this country has seen. If this doesn't get him to step out of politics then I don't know what will. Before you start bitching without reading the actual article, the last sentence in the article should boil down the main point for you.\n\n>Modi has been able to neutralise the decades-old social engineering formula of caste-based parties. And this change may be here to stay.\n\nWhatever his government might do for the country in the next 5 years, he has indeed destroyed the caste based voting that has plagued India for must of its post independence existence.\n\nHopefully no more \"I voted for him because we're of the same cast\" bullshit. The most liked person won.. democracy 101 I am so sad :( but congratulations to modi and his supporters. India's people have spoken clearly, loudly and across regions, castes and classes. They want Modi, and no one will do. As a person who believes in democracy, I respect this mandate of the people, even though I personally do not agree with it.\n\nPersonally, I think Modi's appeal and Amit Shah's strategy work like magic on India's people. I also feel that Modi and Shah will rule India for another 10-20 years.\n\nThere is probably some ground reality truth that is not being reported amidst all the right and left wing media reports. I don't know. But however different my own social, economic and political opinions are, I cannot disagree with facts. That's just basic science. India is now Modi's country.\n\nMay the Almighty grant Modiji health, peace of mind and a genuine sense of security and the wisdom to see that this time, again, he has got a chance to actually do good long-term beneficial things for India and for Indians.\n\nGujarat already has a massive solar park. The Modi Govt has already done one tree-plantation drive. Climate change and water shortage do not discriminate based on how you voted or who you support. Hence, it is important for all of us to realise that we will be forced to work together to prevent a dystopia, to prevent riots and to prevent Army rule and revolution. \n\nIt is here that Modiji can actually make a change. Once again, he finds that he has the luxury of a simple majority. Destiny does not give such chances to many people, especially in a democracy. If he really wants to be the Nehru of this century, he can do that in the next 5 years by focussing on climate change and the environment.\n\nHe could ban plastic, he could mandate glass and metal containers for liquid foods, he could give a massive boom to the refrigeration and food storage industry by making a dozen cold storage warehouses in each constituency and in one fell swoop, he can remove the decades-old distress of the farmers by removing control of the middlemen. \n\nHe could make a new ministry for Nitin Gadkari - Electric Transport Minister - and order him to layout plans for electrification of Indian railways - something that is already in starting stages.\n\nHe could rebrand MNREGA and start a \"Harit Bharat\" campaign like the Swachch Bharat campaign and get people to plant trees and forests. In the Sangh, he has a massive civilian army of completely dedicated, able-bodied men who will dutifully follow all of his orders in letter and spirit. Trees and forests are not political. But rain, water and crop failure can become political. Even strategically speaking, any leader who ensures water supply to rural India will be rewarded amply with votes and devotion.\n\nThe important thing is for him to realise that he has been given the rare second chance by destiny to become a great man and go down in history as a nation-builder.\n\nI hope he will see this opportunity. I wish him the very best in nation-building.\n\nIt was a very enlightening election and in the coming days everyone will have a lot to learn and possibly to adapt. I think it's time for me to go back to science and technology and leave the politics to the truly passionate. I don't have the stomach for it.\n\nWishing Modiji all the best.\n\nBMKJ, VM.\n\nPS: This is my last post. I won't be replying. No hard feelings. India gets what india deserves. This is clearly rejection of creation of fake propaganda, caste politics and fear psychosis. I have never voted. I was in hostel for Vajpayee's election and have lived out of the country since the late 90s. \n\nWhen the country was prospering under Vajpayee, it was a shock to me to see him lose, but it was understandable to some extent. A lot of people felt left out of India shining. Then you had a lost decade under the Congress. \n\nThis time I was apprehensive that Indians would make the same mistake. I am glad they did not. Isn't it too early to write off caste politics when we get dalits getting attacked for no reason regularly? Modi may have unified but caste still runs in this country. It's like celebrating a winning a race with only 2 people when one is handicapped n",

They're making him into a hero for the public there and hoping that the street cred he gets will translate into votes for him in the upcoming UT elections (whenever they are). It's eerily reminiscent of the British Indian Govt's attitude of building up the Congress (and specifically Gandhi) by engaging with them. jailing their leaders but not kala pani types, making deals with them etc. The most famous eg is that of Lord Irwin dealing with Gandhi one on one to settle the CDM which instantly made Gandhi extremely powerful much to the chagrin of pro British elements in India. It was still smart on the part of the Brits in hindsight. Maybe? They definitely have to. \nIt will be a new shift in politics of Kashmir which will revolve around integration of kashmiris with India and the influx of migrants.",

I believe the Congress is stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\nOne one hand, Rahul Gandhi should resign and hand over the leadership (given the abject performance 2 elections in a row). \n\nOn the other hand, there are no viable leaders in the party with a national presence (or even a regional presence). Thus, Rahul’s resignation may lead to power struggles or very weak leadership which can cause the party to split and disintegrate. And if this happens, there will be no national level party left to challenge the BJP (for multiple election cycles to come, given that it takes a long time to get a party established at a national level; and with the BJP controlling the media, it will be nearly impossible for a new, or even existing, party to make itself known and heard). This helps the BJP much more than if Rahul stays on.\n\n\nDamned if you do, damned if you don’t. I only hope they elect someone competent and not rush to the sibling. What the INC should do is learn from other democracies. In the UK for instance they have elections with candidates which the party members vote on. \n\nLet the INC come up with a few candidates who share their vision for the party, let members vote on them. And not FPTP, use a better system like IRV so you get a leader that most of the party actually wants. \n\nAt this point, the CWC saying they're open to radical changes but not to letting RaGa go is ludicrous. You can't demand accountability and responsibility from your state level leaders if you don't demand it from your national leadership. Sachin Pilot should replace him. I think, in the long run, this will help Rahul Gandhi's political career. He should just quit his party posts and tour the entire country for the next five years or so, and then make a comeback. He should take notes from Jagan Reddy. I do not have any hope left, INC is at a stage which Apple was after their failure with the Newton, the INC is going to require a fucking miracle to get them out of this fucking ridiculous situation they dug themselves in.

Have a very clear idea about why you are going for your MBA( or any masters for that matter). If you were forced into your bachelor's or you didn't like the stream you took in your bachelor's and so want to change, your masters will be the best way for you to change streams.\n\n\nTwo friends of mine who did engineering and didn't like it are currently going for their masters in US next month. One for video game design and one for data analytics. They both took the time out after engineering to understand what would work for them, worked hard towards getting the right credentials and then applied to some big universities and got it.\n\nI did my MBA from a top 20 school in the country and still hated it. Purely because I went for MBA only for the bahuth scope hair bullshit. Scope is there only if you slog your ass off,which I didn't.\n\nSo if you are going for an MBA, talk to a whole lot of people before you male your decision same question here Don't go for any course if you don't know why you are doing it. Many young relatives come to my for mba advise disillusioned after grad but can't answer simple questions like what do you think you will be doing after mba? Do you have any idea about the kind of work you will be doing after the mba? Heck mostly they don't even know what specialization they like, marketing? Sales? \n\nIt's stupid just do a course going in blind becuase \"scope acha hai\" Best to work for a couple of years and get some soft skills before higher studies. Remember if you want to do a job then managing people and politics matters a lot in your success. In my advice, getting some work experience just buys you time and helps you take better decisions. If you work for about a year or two, it would give you more clarity with respect to what you want to do in your career, perhaps you might like the job and stay back. More importantly, it would give you time to think with respect to what you want to do in life.\n\nI am an IT engineer myself and had plans of doing MS from the USA. But my sister suggested me to wait and probably work for a year or two to get some clarity. In the two years I worked, I realized that perhaps tech is not my cup of tea. An average job and a below-average pay made me realize that maybe an MBA is a way out.\n\nBut honestly, working for two years is not something I will ever regret because it gave so much more than time, it also gave me some money every month and made me financially independent.\n\nSo spent a good amount of time in my life to crack all the top exams, and finally cracked them and got into one of India's top 5 MBA colleges. With regard to placements, as someone pointed out, freshers don't really have problems getting placed as nowadays companies want more freshers. However, they do miss out on certain roles and processes which are reserved only for those who have a decent 2 years of work experience.\n\nLet me know if you need any help with the MBA scene.",

    "comment" : " I closely followed him since 2015. And one thing you can't deny is that he really did tried hard. From US to Germany, he was always trying to improve his public image. Unfortunately, he failed.\n\nOne thing that these election results tell us is that people absolutely don't want to see another Nehru Gandhi family member as PM anytime in near future. \n\nEven as someone who has a soft corner for RaGA, I think he's an incompetent piece of shit. CWC won’t accept it I think a better option would be for Rahul Gandhi to retire and let Congress be acquired by AAP. Kejriwal can lead the combined parties and give Rahul Gandhi external affairs portfolio, where he can enjoy his lifestyle. Bas kar pagle rulayega kya !!! Jagan Mohan Reddy tried hard for 11 years in opposition to TDP and Congress and he has finally succeeded. Rahul Gandhi should continue but instead of making his image he should now remove all bootlickers in Delhi and concentrate on giving leadership and independence to state leaders like Capt Amrinder Singh in Punjab or how YSR was in Andhra Pradesh. He should start a padhyatra for the next 5 years talk and have dialogues with all walks of life instead of just doing roadshows during elections. CWC rejects his resignation So Rahul if doesn't retire will be only congress Prez who helped BJP win twice and will be actively working for helping them win the third time Someone point me to the cartoonist please? Been seeing some of their cartoons and want to follow more of their work. Thanks! they should make Pm candidate cause BJP made this election like presidential election like america..  rahul should step down as president Of INC but should be in politics and work in congress committee Also congress should work eith chanakya Rahul did the right kind of campaign, he spoke about development, jobs, equality and inclusion but it didn't work out in the current political climate which creates hate and fear among people. Many people believe the myths and conspiracy theories as true events and very difficult to convince them that those are fake. Also this political climate in India is not an aberration but in synch with what is happening across the world. Only way to handle these is to counter them with facts and truth non stop and neturalise them. Start with ridiculing forwards and outright reject them as fake even if you feel it's true. Modi created hysteria in mindset of masses that Gandhis and congress were corrupted since last 60 years and only we are serving nation as he is from humble background.",

If they had put efforts during the election they may have had old India back. \n\ni am seriously pissed off. Rahul Gandhi stays off of all politics after the defeat and then one of the first thing he does is put out that New India tweet. does this guy like being ridiculed. I rather have them seriously taking off the government in the parliament than just offering movie dialogues. Some powerful word were used 🙏🏻🇮🇳 Its only a matter of time more people will see the incompetence and danger of the bjp in the coming 5 years. Hate politics only have a short term mileage. Wasn't this actually created by Congress for last 70 yrs by dividing people through caste and religion? An old India where dynasty, scams, corruption, nepotism and riots ruled? sigh, we miss it.

We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.\n\nThe principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.\n\n**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.\n\nWe believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:\n\n1. The primacy of fundamental human rights\n2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.\n\n**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**\n\nThis is a 50-year project.\n\nThe RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.\n\nOur goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.\n\n**Metrics driven**\n\nWe will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:\n\n1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)\n2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)\n3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)\n4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)\n5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)\n6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)\n7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)\n8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)\n9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)\n10. Gender equality report (87/144)\n\nWe will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.\n\n**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**\n\nCapitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.\n\n**We are committed to internal democracy**\n\nAs a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.\n\n**National security**\n\nWe will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.\n\n**Caste and reservations**\n\nWe absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.\n\nOver 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.\n\nOur approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.\n\n**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**\n\nWe believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.\n\nIndividuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.\n\n**Science and business**\n\nWe will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.\n\n**Join us or improve us**\n\nIf this is a vision that appeals to you, please become a member. If you strongly disagree with any of these points, please do not become a member. Instead, you could follow our page and share your views from time to time, to help us from the outside think through our positions more rigorously.

    "comment" : " 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?\n2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?\n3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.\n\nA few tips from my side:\n\n1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.\n\n2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.\n\nBJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices. If this appeals to you, please follow this page and share the link: [Indian Humanist Party](https://www.facebook.com/TheIndianEnlightenment/)\n\nIf you would like to sign up to be a member of this community, please send a request to the Closed group:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/648319139007128/?source\\_id=323301051671944](https://www.facebook.com/groups/648319139007128/?source_id=323301051671944)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  \nTwitter [https://twitter.com/IndHumParty](https://twitter.com/IndHumParty)  \n\nMedium [https://medium.com/@indianhumanistparty/](https://medium.com/@indianhumanistparty/) >\t\n\n>\tOur goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition\n\nWhat RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. \n\nI feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. \n\nLook at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. \n\nTherefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.\n In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. \n\nOverall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  \nI look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually.",

Ploy to take attention away from his video games remark about army Rajiv Gandhi was a disaster. \n\nBut why is Modi campaigning against Rajiv Gandhi in 2019? Set to the tune of Apple bottom jeans.  \nModi had them shirt and khakis (khakis)  \nBoot lick fuhrer (fuhrer)  \nThe country was lookin' at fuhrer  \nHe took the throne (he took the throne)  \nNext thing you know  \nModi got low low low low low low low low  \nThem Bulgari shirt pants and the boots with the straps (the straps)  \nNo progeny cos he got sterilized   \nSo he took the throne   \nNext thing you know  \nModi got low low low low low low low low It's almost like without the Gandhi dynasty the BJP would have nothing to talk of... I'm beginning to think that Modi requires the Gandhi name more than raga Why is he criticizing Rajiv Gandhi now? Why not fight elections on policies instead of insults? In my opinion, this is shameful for someone who holds the prestigious position of the Prime Minister of India. Can anyone clarify why he is calling Rajiv Gandhi \"corrupt no 1\"? This PM is a shame for our country. He is a blot in our history. Chokeslam? Nikalon in desdhrohiyon Ko Hume naukri do inki jagah , /s",

There are so many such videos featuring AOC and other elected representatives in USA which makes for interesting viewing. USA is just as messed up as India but at least individual elected politicians there seems to have some kind of power which seems to be missing around here. We need politicians like her, but politicians like her will not survive the Indian political system. American politics is dirty, but nothing compared to Indian politics. She is #BlueTrump, and coincidentally might be the next president after trump too. If you are conservative and you underestimate her, you're going to be conservative version of 2016's left. Myawati or riot. This is how a politician like her will he treated in India. 1) She is a female, so she has to be sati savitri and indian kulch pliable. Because she won’t be she will be called a whore or something of that euphemism. 2) She is going to be mercilessly called names for being a female 3) She has morals. Big no no in Indian politics India has multiple politicians like her. There's multiple social democratic parties in India. We saw politicians like her emerge in this election like Atishi. The conservative right wing majority ensured that such politicians will not come up in India. \n\nThat being said, politicians like her are needed, who come up with implementable policies and not like bullshit like NYAY. She is a badass. USA politics or Indian politics, she will survive and thrive. We already have our own AOC, she's called Smriti Irani.\n\n¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n\nEdit: guys, issa yoke. Can't you see the emoji above. 70% marginal tax rate for income above 10 million is a dumb idea, stemming from a lack of understanding of how economics works. We had those the of tax rates in India in 70s, look how that turned out. I don’t think India should consider American governance as a role model in first place .",

    "comment" : " You are not supposed to know everything. Just start reading Newspapers, you'll automatically start picking up topics of interest and gain knowledge about them. If you'll force yourself to know about something just to make conversation trust me it won't work. Media right now in this country is either paid for by one side or the other. We are in a dire need of a neutral channel/source. \n\nI would suggest you try to balance yourself with opinions from all side. I would suggest you to look for sources from both sides of the coin. Do not place yourself in the source which suits your view of the world most. It would result in a echo-chamber.\n\nAlso, don't close yourself to the only English sources. 88% of the country is not English speaking. I would suggest to check sources of local languages as well.\n\nI disagree with the subreddit of /r/India at many points but I still engage in this subreddit in a polite manner. /r/India is a good source for news. Like /u/igivequalityhugs, I would suggest for you to research issues which are interesting to you.\n\n> I feel that if there was a detailed discussion about these topics, I wouldn't be able to contribute much to the conversation and I'd like to change that.\n\nIf you don't know anything about the issue, try to listen to what others are saying. It may not be true but it will definitely give you a starting point. These are meant to only be suggestions, and heavily biased ones, but:\n\n**Do:**\n\n* Pick a (good) newspaper, subscribe, and read it every day. Your definition of \"Good\" will be different from mine, but best to steer clear of anything Times of India-ish, i.e. whose definition of news skews towards only Bollywood, sports and politics. Physical papers in my mind are much better, but e-papers (actual subscriptions, *not* just the website) are good too. \n\n* Read (good) books, on topics surrounding the issues discussed in the news. Nothing happens in a vacuum, and everything has historicity. That historicity may not be evident at first glance, and so reading books that give you context will help you deep dive.\n\n* Google things when you read them and you don't have context. Or, if you don't have time, write them down on a note or something and revisit them later. \n\n* Understand the rough difference between news, opinions, and events. The event is the important thing that is happening. \"News\" is updates on the facts that surround those events. Opinions are interpretations by experts on the facts that surround the event. Not all events are important, not all news is real/relevant, and not all opinions are true. \n\n* Develop your understanding from multiple sources. Context is important, facts are important, history is important. Any one source will miss out on some of all of those three. \n\n* Use your head. If something seems to good to be true, it often is. so that's when you deep dive and do a little digging to understand what isn't being told to you. This is the part where you change from being a passive consumer of news to an active participant in current events. \n\n* Attend public talks, public panel discussions, book launches, etc. that are in your area (if you live in a major city). a lot of them are masturbatory exercises in self-aggrandisement, but they usually have experts who have had time to hone convincing arguments that are worth listening to even if you don't believe them ultimately.\n\n* Learn how to form your own opinion. Everything should be questioned. Even if you're Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro fan, be one after doing the proper leg work and thinking about what they're saying. \n\n\n**Don'ts**\n\n* Do not rely on apps, blogs, and youtube channels. Apps will always shorten the information, so you don't get the detailed discussion: at best you'll get a few extra sentences to a headline that give you the wrong context entirely: InShorts is a horrible app and it becomes *very* obvious when someone's entire argument is derived from an InShorts piece (or for that matter, a reddit post). Blogs can be great sources of information perspectives that could otherwise be suppressed, but you need to be sure that you have the ability to separate the bullshit from usefulness. There are blogs out there that unequivocally support demonetisation, for instance. The same goes for youtube channels: there's only so much they can dive into a topic, and there's a lot that goes unsaid. They're great for getting some background and as a starting point in some instances, but they *cannot* form the entirety of your understanding of a topic. Or rather, they should not. \n\n* Do not read a billion different sources. Not all events have equally weighted sides (e.g.: Climate change). And honestly, trying to find a billion sources can become exhausting. Pick a main source you tend to trust, and a few others to cross-check.\n\n* Do not watch TV panels on a regular basis. 99% of the time, the amount of time and energy you waste on watching a panel on TV would be better served reading something.\n\n* Do not use Reddit as more than a jumping-off point. Reddit is great as an aggregator of links that are useful, and it's fun to talk to others and see what opinions people have about news that's happening, but it's not a substitute for doing your own legwork. It's an echo-chamber.\n\n\n**My own imperfect means of staying current**\n\n1. I use The Hindu as my main source of information.\n\n2. I've set up an RSS feed using Feedly to access the Press Information Bureau website for government updates\n\n3. I read a lot. And Google/wikipedia what I don't know, and then use the sources contained therein to go deeper when I have the time. (this helps me when something's happening on, say, Twitter, where I can find out what's happening without getting sucked into it).\n\n4. I will very occasionally watch Lok Sabha TV/ Rajya Sabha TV\n\n5. I'll always read links that friends send my way, because I'm lucky enough to have informed  friends so even if \nwhat they send is complete trash, it's still trash worth having a glance at. The old school way, newspapers and magazines. Especially the editorial sections. Whatever you do, don't use reddit and r/india as a source to better understand Indian politics or news. Freaking biased as fuck Read the hindu and watch RSTV shows the Big picture, india's world, policy watch and security scan As others mentioned, read newspapers. Understand differences between editorials, opinions and facts. Read books. History, politics etc. There's no one textbook that you can read and understand entire politics. Start with India's political history, read India After Gandhi. \n\nIf you travel, I recommend listening to podcasts. It takes the weight off your shoulders of finding relevant topics. The Seen and the Unseen is a good podcast, Newslaundry has some good ones - Hafta and Charcha. You'll only get a better understanding by exposing yourself to multiple ideas - newspapers, books, podcasts etc. And keep away from any apps that try to save your time. Understanding news and making sense of it takes time, there's no way around that. Apps that try to save your time will eventually turn click baity. Vision ias monthly current affairs . They are concise and free of cost . I am cereal readin papers don't work cause it functions with presupposed familiarity. because they don't have infinite space. so first you gotta contextualize it. talk to people. because there is no beginner-oriented source I know of, except your smart friends. \n\nslightly longer path: correct way to read papers: pick the biggest stories of the paper, doesn't matter which paper. cover story of the Sunday et, etc. strongly suggest the epapers...just select and Google what you don't get..\n\nanother pointer: read up on past scandals..it's a finished story, not one you have to watch unfold over weeks/months, it's got the most info on the underbelly if there is one, and it gives you greater idea about the economy and it's structure, which does not change over decades.. \n\nslowly you'll start being able to contextualise the lakh crores, the budget, get a broad overview of the industries, etc. it's a long path but an important one, I'm also just beginning it. fucking genx left us fuckall in terms of infrastructure, pollution, population, we have to wade into their muck now.. Not sure if someone has already suggested this but podcasts are a GREAT way to catch up on Indian politics and current affairs. I listen to News and Views and the Big Story. Both of them are by the Quint and regularly add short episodes. There's also The Seen and the Unseen which has much longer discussions. The Pragati Podcast and Ganatantra are pretty good too. \n\nTalking Books is one of my favourites. They invite authors and discuss their books. Topics are wide ranging. It's by Indian Express. Stop browsing r/India for news.",

You lost some imaginary points on an app. So drivers can rate riders too? /r/thatHappened Contradiction bias. Lol. i once got a bad rating from Uber in Mumbai because I paid by cash, and he was not happy with the fare i paid. \n\nThe ratings system is useless as a measure because we base our decisions on unrelated factors. \n\nFun fact: You cannot rate uber drivers who call you up and ask you for destinations and then cancel. You can on Ola. \n\nBonus: The driver can put any reason in for cancellation and you will never know (like customer not located, or customer not safe, met with an accident, or some shit like that) Don't disrespect our supreme leader. I think you got away lightly. Those crazies are ready to assault or even murder over far more trivial things. This is called democracy. While you have the right to discuss Modi's failures, he has the right to rate you one star.",

My last name was coined from Marx and Lenin and was given to me by my Left-leaning parents,” she said.\nAtishi said her husband’s name was Pravin Singh and her father’s Vijay Singh. \n\n> Two days ago, former Congress MLA Asif Muhammad Khan had raked up the issue of her religion at a public meeting, which was also attended by party candidate Arvinder Singh Lovely. \n\n> On Sunday, Atishi said: “They cannot question the work of AAP government and they cannot talk about their own work. This is why they are spreading lies about my caste and religion. It indicates that Lovely is going to lose his deposit and has accepted defeat,” she said. \n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/elections/lok-sabha-elections-2019/delhi/news/atishi-clarifies-on-her-religion-hits-out-at-cong/articleshow/69087729.cms Haven't seen the video. Why should it matter even if she were a Jew? And so what if she's Jewish? Shame on Congress for not only lying about it, but for making the fact of someone being Jewish a political issue. Shame. Congress will save us from the communal politics Heh, the last 48 hours have been zany. We had our own \"The Jew fears the Samurai\" moment. Jew ho ya mountain dew as long as she is good candidate I would vote for her. Her work and ethics are her choice, the religion she was born in sadly isn't. People need to get their priorities right I don't know.  Hardcore sanghis love Israel.  So I guess they would vote for Atishi - wouldn't they? Indian politics is just based on caste and religion.\n\nShe dropped her traditional surname and adopted for a surname \"marlena\", which is derived from Marx and Lenin. She wanted that people should judge her based on her work rather than her lineage. \n\nBut if a political party is spreading false rumors about her, she has to defend it. There is nothing wrong if she would have been a Jew. But have a common voter would have voted for a Jew Atishi. No, because no one cares about the real work done by the candidate, it all boild down to what your caste and what is your religion. First time ever I've heard of someone being called a Jew in India as a negative thing. Usually we love Israelis, esp in Goa.\n\nSo anti-semitism has reared its ugly head here as well? Damn. Practicing Muslim and a hardcore anti-zionist here.\n\n\nI don't give a single shit if she's a jew. She did more in 5 years for her constituency than what Muslim Leaders in mine for the last 20 years. So fuck them, fuck BJP, fuck Congress and fuck everyone piggyback on making the chutiya out of Muslims and fuck these retarded Muslims who fall into the nonsensical \"all Jews are bad\" trap. Why should it matter if the candidate is Jewish or something else?",

Religion and politics cant go together This is good as long as it is accompanied by proper medical attention and the patients consent to listening to the chants. Many people find chants relaxing. What if they're not Hindu?.It shouldn't be compulsory for all but if someone wants it then no issues but actual treatment should not be compromised. To be honest, I find gospel chants more relaxing Nothing wrong in trying it, but it should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as every other medical treatment. The results of its efficacy must be evaluated and published and peer reviewed before it is universally adopted. Soft hindutva Har jagaah ghuss rakha hai ye fuddu sa mantra. Bhagwakaran",

There was so much support for her on Twitter. And now all of them would be repenting it. \n\nLPT: Never support a politician. And she's joined the Shiv Sena.. lmao Few points independent of each other\n\n- Goons and lumpen elements in the party are shameful. For morality and decency, they should have been dealt with.  The blame on the incident is only on the those people and no one else. \n\n- She was a great spokesperson. Made good contrubutions to the party. A loss for the party no matter how you put it. \n\n- If the reports of her joining the Shiv Sena are true then, well that party has no shortage of goons either. It would have been better if she had joined another party, AAP, JDS, TRS etc. Any party except this. \n\nAnyway best of luck to her. I am sorry for the way she was treated. Everyone knows shiv senas selling point is women empowerment. She spoke of secularism  \nNow she joined shiv sena  \nOnce a lodu said  \nHypocrisy ki bhi hoti hai seema In chutiyon ke liye ideology wideology kuch nahi hai. Sirf ticket dedo toh kutte ki tarah wafadaari karenge Good for her to take a stand. Congress probably needs her more than she needs Congress, and how much of leaders would Scindia and RG be if they cant fight for the right thing within their own party. I wonder what song will Priyanka Chaturvedi sing after joining Shiv Sena later on. It was \"Rishto ke bhi roop badalte hai, naye naye saanche mein dhalte hai\" few days back. \"Ek political party se jaenge, ek pe aagaye hain\" will suit her today. Damn. She took a hard plunge. From being National Spoke person of INC to joining a regional party which don't even have a proper post of spoke's person. She is not getting any ticket from SS in this election. Even if she gets MLA ticket in the next election, SS cadre will not support her. There are no prominent Women leader in SS and that is because of their feudal mindset. Besides she is from UP. Sometimes I think I do not understand politics at all. Good for her. She wasn't given the due importance in the party anyway because of inter politics within her own party.",

And while there are so many iconic Vietnam films that tell about the stories of the war, the Korean war is long forgotten.\n\nI mean Indian sepoys have fought in South Africa as a part of the Boer wars as well, there are so many things the mainstream overlooks in history .

You got it wrong OP, not saying you got it wrong about Varun but you are wrong about dynasties.\n\nDynastic politics is absolutely bad. That doesn't mean that Tendulkar's son Arjun should quit cricket. If Arjun is a deserving cricketer he gets a chance, not because of his dad but because of his effort. \n\nDynastic politics is bad only because people get their place from influence, if thats not the case then it's fine. \n\nIn Varun's case, he is not getting votes because he is a Gandhi, he is getting votes because of BJP/Modi. Also his dad wasn't a PM, his mom wasn't a fake PM. That's a huge difference between him and RaGa. But there is nothing inherently bad about dynasties. It is ones that continue to thrive despite dysfunction and failure that truly affect people negatively. The Patnayak dynasty in Odisha was immensely successful. YSR’s dynasty is also doing a decent job election-wise in AP.\n\nI don’t get what’s the point of vilifying dynasties per se. No political/social/commercial system is completely free of dynasties. These systems are rooted in experience gained through mentor-mentee relationships. Parents are mentors all the time. Varun Gandhi is a regular MP whereas RaGa is the party president. NaMo, Shah, Rajnath, Jaitly, Sushma, none of them are Dynasts. When you become the next BJP chief minister just because your father was the chief minister then call me. It is not so easy in BJP Its funny how people equate kids joining their parents profession ( prevalent everywhere ) to a party run by the whim of an authoritarian family. Dynasties will never end.",

Sadly there are no points for second place. Congress needs to reinvent itself to be relevant,. We need more senior educated workers to come to the forefront and take the lead from the Gandhis. Religion based politics will fail one day. On that day we need a stronger Congress ready to rebuilt and take India forward. The sad reality is Congress is Gandhi family and Gandhi family is Congress. The moment Gandhis say we will step down from active politics then Congress will cease to exist. \n\nIrony is Gandhis nahi toh Congress will fragment into so many pieces that collecting them will be useless. \n\nI kinda felt during the 2019 election campaigning that Congress is not looking for the win but trying to revive the party from its 44 MP seats so that it can be on a strong foothold in 2024 elections. \n\nThey started bit late squandering the first couple of years but demonetisation onwards they started to pick pace but they stuck too much time to Chowkidar chor hai and rafale rather than ground issues such as employment, farmer distress, etc. \n\nCongress didn't want to raise Pulwama and not do any politics but ultimately it was something BJP milked the cow dry on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nwell to all the anti-Modi people..\n\nAh Shit! Here we go again! RaGa did an alright job in the last few months. However, he was too late to the party. \n\nNow to defeat Thanos congress might need Priyanka Gandhi as the front and center of the 2024 campaign. That woman can speak! And a misogynistic party like BJP need to be defeated by a woman to show them their place. I will call 2024 as Thanos's endgame from the hands of congress. 2019 was not the year. They all were too late. When Priyanka joined in Jan, she took the headlines for a month before BJP had to do pulwama to take all the attention away. After that, there has been no looking back for BJP.\n\nCongress needs to be a great opposition for the next 5 years to be relevant or this is the end of the road for them.\n\nAs for us, the light at the end of the tunnel is not hope but a moving train. [removed] RaGa for 2024 . Earlier I was outraged when BJP bhakts pledged for Congress Mukt bharat but now I think India will be better off without congress, we need a strong alternative that can firmly stand with secular, pluralistic and liberal ideology, hardocre Hindutva of BJP will always trump the Soft Hindutva of Congress",

If there is such person, then s/he is either made irrelevant (Anna Hazare, Medha Patkar) or ends up dead for going against the corrupt system. AoC isn't a gem but Andrew Yang certainly is Yogendra Yadav and Atishi Marlena come to mind. I might not agree with all of their policies especially YY but these two come across as earnest politicians who want to do good to the society. There could be more that I might not know. Modi I understand the intent of your question but AoC is *certainly* not a gem. Yang is, though! I like Pete Buttigieg over Sanders and AOC among the Dems. AOC comes across as well-intentioned and earnest but occasionally naive. Sanders' policy platform is an unsustainable mess. Good intentions aren't worth much on their own if you're not the sharpest cookie in the box.  \n\n\nIn general I'm skeptical of economically left-wing people, they're either naive - don't understand why their nice-sounding ideas don't actually work...  \n...or manipulative psychopaths - they pretend to care about the people and promise them free shit to get elected.   \n\n\nIn India   \nCongress: Sachin Pilot and Shashi Tharoor. Both come across as rather principled and sincere to me.   \nBJP: Piyush Goyal. Atishi Marlena \n\nManish Sissodia\n\nSachin Pilot\n\nSuresh Prabhu \n\nThese are my choices Arvind Kejriwal Sashi Tharoor? Idk Not really . Not Bernie Sanders \n\nEconomists generally aren't fond of free college https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/26/468298576/economists-on-candidates-proposals-mostly-bad\n\nYou can even go to r/Askeconomics (they provide sources and if comments don't have sources , they get removed) to ask about what economists think of free college\n\nIt's not that free college is a bad idea . Economists favor making college free only for the poor and not the rich . \n\nHowever there are alternative policies that are just as good for example Australia . \n\nMost of their universities are public which is why they are so cheap and prices don't inflate much  . Plus they have HECS loan system , Where you can get a zero interest loan and you only have to start paying it if you're earning above a certain threshold and if you don't then you don't need to make any payment and you have the peace of mind that your loan obligations will expire eventually . Though many loans might not be paid back and might be forgiven by the taxpayer . That's fine because it's cheaper than universal programs\n\nEven if your income reaches that threshold where you have to make payments of that loan . It'll only be 4 or 8 % of your income . This should be seen as graduate tax imo \n\nSo not free college but really close to it . Economists favor those policies over free college . It doesn't make sense to make college free given that the personal  return on investment is high on a college degree . However public subsidies can still exist like the Aformentioned system\n\nForgiving everyone's student loans isn't exactly rooted in good economics \n\nHowever that's not to say the good welfare policies can't exist.  The aformentioned one is  close to free college. Economists tend to prefer economically progressive policies over universal this and Universal that and also don't like  stupid proposals like   privatising everything \n\nUniversal healthcare is widely supported though",

Being a Pakistani, I feel Modi is your version of General Zia.\n\nThat jackass brought religion into Pakistani politics and set us back 30 years. You guys will soon learn that use of religion in politics is the most powerful tool. But it also destroys democratic values. \n\nAlso, it will work even after mr Modi retires. Some one else will learn to exploit it just like we still have jokers even though Zia has been long dead \n\nMany of us still curse Zia There are two sections of people who want Modi to be back - BJP in India, and the Pakistani military (and their puppets) in Pakistan. Oof. He knew his name will be misused as BJP were trying to spread hatred against Congress by using Pakistan. 1-0 to Imran. If Imran Khan expected this, I will call this a brilliant move. Sometimes sharp words don't make the desired result which sweet words can. Wasn't congress the one who wanted peace talks with pakistan , so if imran khan thinks modi will be better for peace shouldnt they be happy if modi wins Me thinks IK's remarks are a sign of the times...whatever the oppn says abt this, but it is an endorsement of reality https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/80909355/ye-kya-ho-raha-hai.jpg",

There are hindus who eat beef, there are chritians and there r other people from backward castes as well. This is just a political game for divide and rule India is not a theocracy, yet. A lot of these people actually think that eating cow meat is disrespecting their religion. How hard is it to understand that not everyone  considers the cow to be sacred? Absolutely ridiculous. What kind of idiotic article is this?\n\nFirst of all. Calling for beef ban is regressive and implementation of upper caste food habits on others.\n\nAnd for communal harmony. That reason is idiotic because beef is not the only way muslims are being attacked. Muslims are being made to chant jai shri ram. It's an issue of Hindutva supremacy.\n\nAnd why are they calling for central ban? In South beef is openly available. Even though beef is banned in karnataka, nobody implements it. Cows were slaughtered for bakrid and I didn't see any objection. Common people don't really care unless groups like bajrang dal try to stir shit. Why are they trying to implement cow belt nonsense everywhere in India?\n\nSome clerics in North india may have asked for people to not eat beef because of violence. Don't take that and generalize to all of Indian muslims.\n\nAnd lol at them giving examples from pre independent India to support their central beef ban nonsense. I was wondering who could treat muslims as a monolithic entity while claiming that they want a ban on cow slaughter, till I reached the end. Observer research foundation. That's who. I see an attempt at claiming that the ban demand is really about the environment, and not just religion, being made by some lawyer in the article. I wonder if he wants a complete milk ban. Short of that, slaughter ban increases green house gases production, as many more cattle than the milk producers have to be kept alive and producing methane.\n\nIn the long run, of course, the cow slaughter ban only guarantees indian cows will go extinct as they become uneconomical, and are replaced with buffaloes which can be slaughtered for meat when not producing milk. No net change for the environment.",

    "body" : "[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]\n\nHi,\nI've been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.\n\nDemocracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.\n\nBut what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.\n\nWith time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. \n\nThis has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.\n\nDo you guys think this is an issue in current times? \n\nIf yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn't give them any benefits?\n\nI believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of \"other\" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.",

    "comment" : " What minority appeasement you talking about? There was no minority appeasement (as Sachar committee report clearly showed) , and development is not a zero-sum game between groups. That minority appeasement leads to or has lead to majority impoverishment/extinction is a propaganda invention of hindutva not proved by any economic or census data. Since it was empty propaganda to start with, there is nothing to go back to. This is an opinion post. Kind of like a change my mind. I am not proposing new agendas, just looking for suggestions to fixing some of the issues related to increasing polarized political opinions Yes I think one of the major reason for the rise of BJP is hate for Congress and its Dynasty type ruling. Modi was elected as there was no one else to lead. \nThe day we have anyone as good as modi, people will forget Modi and move on to the next one. Real-life in Karnataka:   When I was doing my BE. Normal peoples tuition fees with merit were 50k INR per year.\n\nSc/STs were around 25k INR.\n\n(Christians its more than Sc/St I think not sure about this.)\n\nMuslims its 0 INR.\n\nThis is not based on the economy of the family. Just religion.\n\n\nWe all wrote Entrance exam in Karnataka above fees is only who got seats in the merit-based system. But merit rank is not the same for everyone. even there Muslims/Sc/ST had reservations.\n\nI don't what else you can call it other than minority appeasement.\n\n\n\nMost of the temple comes under devasom board in Kerala. Temples cant use its own money from devotees as they want. it all goes to Govt. then govt. decides salaries of priest etc...\n\nSO net flow of money from Hindu institutions is always negative(Temples I Know its more than 25% loss)\n\nNo such things for mosques or churches.\n\n\nThese things really hurt the sentiments of everyday local people. \n\nIf you want secular country Govt, Should treat all religious institutions same, no extra provisions. Just like the US.\n\nI personally think it is not bad if Govt is leaning towards Hindu(Since it is native to India, not an invasive ideology) institutions in India, cause most of \"Secular\" Europe leans towards Christianity. Not to mentions middle east. This is a global phenomenon now. It’s a backlash against way too much overt political correctness. > But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position\n\n> Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem No, it's mainly the incredibly efficient RSS/BJP propaganda machine that is responsible for the situation we see today. But that certainly was not possible by-itself, the opposition failed miserably and offered no resistance. The thing is, Right-wing populism is the easiest thing to sell. It appeals to passion and emotion which are major factors in building up support.",

Or you could become an RTI activist. \n\nTo discuss policies, if you're into IT/Business you could explore creating an Indian version of [Change a view](https://changeaview.com/cav/posts) built by the folks at /r/changemyview and recently [shared by Obama] (https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bj2t51/barack_obama_shares_five_articles_in_a_facebook/). Something which allows discussion and debate instead of user driven answers (Quora) or popular comments (Reddit) Independent journalism. There's a lot of people who took this approach. Paurush Sharma started from scratch and now has over 100K subs on YouTube. I have been watching his videos since he had less than 5K subs. All this happened within a span of a couple of months or so.\n\nOnce you gain some traction and politicians start recognizing you, you can jump into it Probably get on twitter and start replying to people of high stature to get recognised. Have a youtube channel and a facebook page. It is easier now due to social media. Select a small regional party and post in support of them. It would be better if the party doesn't have a clear ideology. So, if you help them to form some ideologies you would get promoted soon. Politics is a popularity contest within a geographically defined target audience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you score well in such a contest?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- By targeting the people in the *geographically defined* audience (not by becoming a youtube star across a geographically broad audience in a narrow socioeconomic stratum)\n\n\\- 100% people in that constituency should know you by name\n\n\\- At least 35% people in that constituency should consider you a *useful* person to their self-interest (not knowledgeable)\n\n\\- At least 50% of people in that constituency *like* you positively\n\n\\- Make strategic alliances with people in power.\n\n\\- Make strategic alignments with the large groups in the constituency, may be on business, caste, religious or other lines. Various groups of people in that constituency should consider your interests aligned to theirs.\n\n\\- Work on your public persona, including voice, looks etc\n\n\\- arrange for some war chest of funds, everything costs money\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUse these to first build a base, then you can do the \"right\" things later on. The best politicians have an unassailable home constituency. That allows them to take anti-majority liberties without always being too conscious. You can't do this until you can get in power, but if you don't have any connections and don't have money and can't scare people, then you can't directly get into politics. At your age, you focus on studying then getting a good job. Once you have job, responsibilities, family you will be a mature person who understands how society works. Then you can get into politics. Media. Don't get into this shithole If on a campus, join student party and be a out n out gunda. Maybe you will be noticed. Take 2 years for each year of course and keep in college for random courses till you can intimidate fuchhas.",

    "comment" : " It's very simple.\n\nThe only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.\n\nJaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of \"surplus\" when in actuality, it's \"reserves\". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.\n\nThe world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!\n\nAnd since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.\n\nThe replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.\n\nMr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.\n\nModi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.\n\nIf these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. \n\nThe request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. \n\nIn a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. \n\nThese people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). \n\nLet's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. \n\nI hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.\n\nThe government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.\n\nThe movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   Why do you think Dr. Kurian didn't think highly of IAS folks, they are generalists not specialists. Das will help with the looting, this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the RBI reserve. Our stewards have turned weak and spineless like Theoden. A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. \n\nAnd to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. \n\nAnd on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen. ",

As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. \n\nAnother uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage. She turned out to be very abusive. The guy was admitted twice to a hospital during the few years of their marriage. He has a son, so he's staying in the marriage for his sake. It's not unheard of when one partner is Indian origin person who got citizenship earlier. Infact, a close friend of mine got into an arranged marriage with a keralite girl with British citizenship and moved. It's probably more common among keralites though. They're experts in migration. I did it. My wife is actually an ex Victoria's Secret model as well. That seems to be one nasty way to emigrate.

    "comment" : " ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** \n\n ______ \nA senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after\nhe got a call from goods and services tax (\n\nGST\n\n) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the\nconstruction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for\nthe executive to explain that the word \"stone\" in the brand name had nothing\nto do with the business the firm was into.\n\nFew kilometres away from the PE firm's office in\n\nMumbai\n\n, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was\nnervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's\n\nGST assessing officer\n\n, and it left him in knots.\n\n\"How does one explain credit\n\nswap\n\nratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?\" he asked his\nchartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some\nqueries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.\n\nAs the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of\nerstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies\nare running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with\nmanufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with\nservice companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.\n\nBut under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared\nand all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile\nVAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.\n\nMany of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately\nasking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.\n\n\"There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to\nvoice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing\nauthorities.\n\nSeveral service providers, whose business models are well known to the central\nauthorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are\napprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on\ntaxation of services,\" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte\n\nIndia\n\n.\n\nIndustry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment\nofficers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair\nlike in the case of income tax. \"One has to deal with officials for refunds,\ncredits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some\ntime before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,\" the senior\nfinance executive in the PE firm said.\n\nThe government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and\ndividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just\nfor PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.\n\nTake the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about\nRs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials\nfor the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.\n\nAnother diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out\nan SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants\nformer state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.\n\nThe manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his\nassessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are\nsomewhat unfounded. \"Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of\nchanging their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has\nundergone training and there is no need to worry,\" a government official in\nthe know clarified.\n\n\"Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods\nand they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials\nwere given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried\nseveral services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,\" said\nSachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,\n\nKPMG India\n\n.\n\nThe worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a\ncomplex subject. \"One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because\nthe tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,\" he laughs. \"However, I\nwould say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they\ndon't understand, and it may just be a good thing.\"\n\nBut not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions\nwhich are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The\ntax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the\nfirm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know\nhow come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for \"merely\ntalking for half an hour\" from a client, but not charging anything from\nanother client with whom she had spoken for two hours.\n\n\"It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is\ncomplex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were\nallotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,\" a senior tax\nadvisor said.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link. > \"How does one explain credit swap ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?\" he asked his chartered accountant who had accompanied him.

That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  \n\n \n\n  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker’s request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  \n\n \n\n  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  \n\n \n\n  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm.

In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.\n\nIndia’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”\n\n“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.\n\nFitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).\n\nAn official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.\n\n“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.\n\nFor all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.\n\nLacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.\n\nIn the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.\n\nYou may also like to watch:\n\nHelping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.\n\nMentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.\n\nAnother example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.\n\nSuch handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.\n\nShanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.\n\nWe have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.\n\nUnder the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.\n\nLakshmi VV\n\nThe author is founding trustee and executive vice president, Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST).\n\nViews are personal\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.\n\nUntil now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India’s tax officials. Come July 1, however, “the party will be over”, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.\n\nA nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country’s biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva’s into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India’s sovereign credit profile.\n\nThe new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.\n\nBecause a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don’t sign up risk losing any customer who has.\n\n“I have no option, but to register with the new system,” said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.\n\nBoosting the coffers\n\nImproved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.\n\nIndia currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.\n\nWhile there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.\n\n“In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,” Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. “Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.”\n\nNair’s company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.\n\nOther companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.\n\nA REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth.

GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth.\n\nWinners and losers\n\nThe unorganised sector of India’s economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.\n\nWhile staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms’ accounting systems and an investment in technology.\n\nThe new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India’s 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.\n\nSanjiv Mehra, head of a traders’ body in Delhi, reckons a “prohibitive” cost could prove to be counterproductive.\n\n“Compliance is needed for input tax credit,” he said. “But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?”\n\nBut despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.\n\nThe government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.\n\nFirms can now move to demand-based “hub-and-spoke” models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.\n\n“Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,” said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. “All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.”\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link. > Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses.

Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.\n\n",

On offer are 53.42 million shares in the price band of Rs 355-358 apiece. The issue will close on Friday.The Jaipur-based company, which has got RBI licence to engage in small finance banking, has already commenced operations. With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) – AU Financiers – before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here’s what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company’s business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB’s gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management’s successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB’s profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. “Despite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,” it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. “We expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB’s market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. “We believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,” the brokerage said.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

Photo: Mint\n\nMumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.\n\nAccording to the revised policy, RBI has defined “a banking outlet” for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank’s staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week”. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called “part-time banking outlet.”\n\nWhile the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI’s permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a “rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‘banking outlet’ of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions”.\n\nWith the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‘banking outlets’ or ‘part-time banking outlets’. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of “banking outlets”. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a “branch” which also included off-site ATMs.\n\nThe proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. “With a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,” RBI had said in the policy statement.\n\nLater an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.\n\nThe revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as “banking outlets” though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. “Nevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,” RBI said.\n\n“This policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,” said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

Graphic: Mint\n\nNew Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.\n\nThe nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.\n\nNot only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.\n\nThe results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.\n\nTo be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.\n\nWhile 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.\n\nThe World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. “The experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,” it said.\n\nIndia’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.\n\nThe NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.\n\nOn average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. “Therefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,” the survey recommended.\n\nConceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that “every single company needs to be told about the changes taking place”.\n\nBased on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.\n\nSome analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. “The robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.\n\nFDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.\n\nCommerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government’s full attention.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.\n \n They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies — who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.\n \n Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals\n Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year\n Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon \n \n In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US — for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.\n \n The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. \"I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,\" says Thapar.\n \n Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. \"These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,\" says Thapar.\n \n At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. \"I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,\" she adds.\n \n Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.\n \n She has launched a program called \"Prerna\" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.\n \n \n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.2a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^blocks ^adblocking.\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^Readability](https://www.readability.com)",

    "comment" : " I think your best option would be to opt for an MBA overseas.  If you want to expand your business, work with your dad and join an entrepreneur/Family Business oriented MBA/PGP program. For example, ISB has one http://www.isb.edu/management-programme-for-family-business.\n\n IMHO, you should go ahead with the MBA. Reasons:\n\n1. It would give you the skillset and network needed to successfully run your dad's business, esp considering that you do not have work ex so far.\n\n2. Even if you plan to stick with finance with the CFA, the MBA will still be a value add as it is highly regarded in finance companies.\n\nA word of advice: Aim high, don't compromise on college because of the high fees. It's not like undergrad, where you can sit in your room at night and catch up on studies even if your profs are no good. In an MBA brand value and peer learning are important. Plus a top tier programme will provide enough return on investment to justify taking an education loan. Instead of CFA or MBA, why don't you try other finance courses too? You can learn with industry experts at Imarticus Learning. They even have placement options, if that is something you are interested in. Visit their website: www.imarticus.org .. They also offer online courses in case you want that flexibility.",

Photo: Reuters\n\nMumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.\n\nThis cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.\n\nThe blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.\n\nInvoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.\n\nAnish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.\n\nThe company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Shah.\n\nBlockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.\n\n“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,” said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.\n\nThe work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, “and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)",

Photo: Mint\n\nNew Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.\n\nModi’s government already had its work cut out to finalise a deal with India’s 29 federal states to launch a goods and services tax (GST) on 1 April that would transform Asia’s third-largest economy into a single market for the first time.\n\nBut his decision to scrap 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge the economy of “black money”, has caused huge disruption.\n\nA slump in business activity stemming from the cash crunch has caused the revenue of state governments, which collect value-added tax on goods and other duties, to slump by 25-40%.\n\nThe states won’t risk another setback by rushing the sales tax into force.\n\n“The investment and economic environment in the country is in bad shape,” said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who earlier head a panel tasked with building a consensus on the GST. “How is the country going to absorb the dual shock of GST and demonetisation?”\n\nThe GST is India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It would replace a plethora of federal and state levies with one tax, easing compliance, broadening the revenue base and boosting productivity.\n\nIt took Modi more than two years to forge a political compromise on the tax in August. Now, demonetisation “has created a trust deficit,” said Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac. “After this, I am not going to sit and compromise. They don’t deserve it.”\n\nLeft in the lurch\n\nFailure to break the deadlock could tip India into a fiscal crisis: The GST would need to come into effect by mid-September, when the old system of indirect taxation is due to lapse. The lingering uncertainty is worrying companies needing to understand financial implications of the new tax.\n\n“With so many vital details still missing, they are feeling left in the lurch,” said Saloni Roy, a senior director at Deloitte.\n\nModi’s shock move last month to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes was aimed at India’s shadow economy. But the ensuing cash crunch has caused job losses, disrupted supply chains and slowed construction activity.\n\nWith cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.\n\nAmbit Capital, a Mumbai brokerage, forecasts growth this fiscal year will be only half of the roughly 7% level many expect. The Reserve Bank of India has shaved its growth outlook by half a percentage point to 7.1%.\n\nTo make up for their losses, states are seeking compensation and will press their case at a meeting in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday with finance minister Arun Jaitley.\n\nHe has already agreed to cover states’ revenue losses for five years after the GST’s launch, but further concessions would narrow his room for manoeuvre in his annual budget presented in February.\n\nOne top finance ministry official dismissed demands for compensation for demonetisation as unreasonable. But states are adamant. “They have brought it upon us,” V. Narayanasamy, chief minister of Puducherry, told Reuters. “Now they must pay for our loss.”\n\nCounting costs\n\nThe quibble is not just over lost revenue. Some states worry about the social and political costs of demonetisation.\n\nTake Kerala, where credit cooperatives that farmers and retired government workers rely on cannot swap old bills or issue fresh notes. The state alleges this has encouraged commercial banks to scout for their deposits, sparking a “run” on them.\n\nOdisha’s chief minister has written to Modi, saying curbs imposed on primary agriculture societies were making it difficult for farmers to access crop loans and procurement payments.\n\nWith the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.\n\nThey want sole control over businesses with annual turnover of Rs15 million ($220,000) and so-called “dual control” over bigger firms. Jaitley opposes this, fearing tax collectors could end up at cross purposes.\n\n“We reached this far because states were willing to compromise,” said Isaac, Kerala’s finance minister, told Reuters. “If they want the GST, they will have to now concede to the states.” Reuters\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.6a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) Narendra Modi’s demonetisation drive has disrupted the consensus needed for GST, plunging his boldest tax reform into limbo that may trigger economic slowdown\n\n---\n\n> * With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.\n\n> * New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modis crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.\n\n> * With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.\n\n> * With the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme",

BUT, the SLA doesn't itself guarantee the up time. If there is a downtime, the provider will simply pay the penalties but your business will be hurt severely.\n\nMake sure to discuss with them your needs of very high up time and get 2 different drops on one line or a backup fixed wireless link.\n\nWith two ISP which have there own backhual that takes data out of India like Tata/Rcom/Vodafone, and two lines from each you can pretty much give you 100% uptime. I am setting up a finance based business currently and am going to use airtel for leased line. They say they guarantee no downtime.\n\nWhat you setting up from the look of it a sub broker or an HFT . Is it an HFT? haha, There was some add for a colocation service in front of the fort starbucks a while back. Sadly, I don't remember the name of the firm. It exists, and perhaps that will help you find it.\n\nAlso, what the heck do you plan to do? Is it whats usually within the intersect of super low latencies, finance, computing and programming?\n Get a Beam static line and a Reliance wireless one. My friend has the same requirement as you do and he too took this. ",

This sector boosts of 57.7 million micro manufacturing, trading, and service businesses, which generate maximum jobs for Indians.\n\n...\n\n>In another landmark scheme, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has launched the Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes to promote entrepreneurship among Dalit community by providing them with easy access to capital at a concessional rate.

It will be run by the National Scheduled Castes Finance and Development Corporation (NSFDC), which is already involved in promoting Dalit entrepreneurship.\n\n...\n\n>India faces the formidable challenge of pulling millions out of poverty and simultaneously ensuring sustainable growth and protecting environment.

Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.\n\nMoving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle.

If you still want a masters then an MBA  from a good university like IIMS or other competitive ones can be a game-changer otherwise they will only waste your precious time. \n\nI would recommend doing a PG in a Metro city like Ahmedabad or Bangalore and then appear for a Bank exam which is great for settling down in India with kids. You’ll have to give GRE/GMAT to get into a ranked university, even in Canada and Australia. UofT, University of Melbourne, UBC, Waterloo, all ask for GMAT/GRE as far as I know. You’re exempt only if you have your undergraduate degree from overseas (US/UK etc.). \n\nCanada (Toronto) has really good opportunities for finance, being that it is very close to NYC, is emerging as a startup hub, all the big banks have offices here etc etc. Opportunities in Aus, although available, might not be as plentiful as in Toronto. \n\nI actually have a few cousins in Aus who are engineers and they have great careers. Anyone outside of the STEM stream isn’t faring that well.\n\nBest of luck, OP!\n\nEdit - I’d advise you to consider a one year Masters from a well known university in Europe to get over your 3 year degree dilemma. There are some universities offering excellent courses in Finance and Economics which will set you up for a good career or PHD and give you some much needed visa points for Canadian/Aus PR. \n\nPlease don’t do Marketing. You can learn it on the job and it doesn’t require any technical training. Don’t waste your money on a marketing course. Similarly, social work is not very well paying. You’d find it hard to sustain if you aren’t well off already. Make sure you have your career path roughly drawn out before you make a move abroad.",

    "body" : "By James M. Dorsey\n\n\n\nA podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.\n\n\n\nWhat do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?\n\n\n\nBoth reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.\n\n\n\nAnd both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.\n\n\n\nRather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.\n\n\n\nA world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.\n\n\n\nNo doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.\n\n\n\nYet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.\n\n\n\nUnderscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.\n\n\n\nThe timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.\n\n\n\nLike in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.\n\n\n\nPakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.\n\n\n\nAnthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.\n\n\n\nFact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.\n\n\n\nWhat Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.\n\n\n\nMr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.\n\n\n\nMr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.\n\n\n\nMr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.\n\n\n\nIt is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.\n\n\n\nFailure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.\n\n\n\nSaid Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”\n\nWhat is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.\n\n\n\nDr. James M.

They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI\n\nNever got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.\n\nJet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!\n\nPS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business.

[deleted] Read this article\n\nhttps://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.\n\nI've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  \nHad a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  \n\nAt the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.\n\n(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.\n\nFlew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...\n\nHated traveling by spice or go or indigo...\n\nAlways got middle seat empty on my sector.\n\nDecently priced.\n\nInternational circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...\n\nIn a race with air india, it was indeed good.\n\nAs for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.\n\nAfter the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. \n\nFlew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees",

    "comment" : " There are multiple factors involved.\n\nFirstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.\nBecause of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.\n\nDhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.\n\nNow Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.\n\nThis is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL.",

This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process. \n\nReviews: [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/how-india-became-democratic-citizenship-and-making-of-the-universal-franchise-review-the-mark-that-makes-us-equal/article23400419.ece), [Livemint](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/BSaQyxisfsjfeL6ji12AqL/The-DNA-of-India.html), and an interview with the author in [The Wire](https://thewire.in/books/india-became-democratic). \n\n■ **Mukulika Banerjee, [Why India Votes?](https://www.routledge.com/Why-India-Votes-1st-Edition/Banerjee/p/book/9781138019713) (Routledge, 2014)**\n\nBanerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process. \n\nReviews in [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/why-india-loves-to-vote/article8581471.ece) and in [Seminar](http://www.india-seminar.com/2014/657/657_books.htm), interview with the author in [NYT](https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/20/a-conversation-with-anthropologist-mukulika-banerjee/), and excerpt of the book in [Caravan](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/the-great-march-of-democracy-book-excerpt). \n\n■ **SY Quraishi, [An Undocumented Wonder: The Making of the Indian Election](http://rupapublications.co.in/books/an-undocumented-wonder-the-great-indian-election/) (Rupa Books, 2014)** and **[The Great March of Democracy](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-great-march-of-democracy/) (Penguin, 2019)**\n\nIf you're interested in the actual nuts and bolts of the how the world's biggest elections are conducted, then these two books by a former Chief Election Commissioner will interest you.

What does, or does not, make India's democracy tick? Is this the end of anti-incumbency? Are opinion polls and exit polls reliable? How pervasive is the 'fear factor'? Does the Indian woman's vote matter? Does the selection of candidates impact results? Are elections becoming more democratic or less so? Can electronic voting machines (EVMs) be fiddled with? Can Indian\n> elections be called 'a jugaad system'? \n> Published on the eve of India's next general elections, The Verdict uses rigorous psephology, original research and as-yet-undisclosed facts to talk about the entire span of India's electoral history from the first elections in 1952. Crucially, for 2019, it provides pointers to look out for, to see if the incumbent government will win or lose.\n\nPrannoy Roy (Author), Dorab R. Sopariwala (Author)\n\nhttps://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-verdict/ Thank you for making the list, OP.  A forthcoming book that looks interesting as well is Ruchir Sharma's Democracy on the Road (Penguin) but I haven't read that as yet.  Thanks for the list OP. There's also a new podcast by Milan Vaishnav called [Grand Tamasha](https://carnegieendowment.org/grandtamasha/) . It is a co-prod with HT and Darnegie Endowment for Peace. I recommend The Verdict. Also off topic, but can someone recommend a book that summarises the Constituent Assembly Debates about what went into making the constitution? mandatory mention of India After Gandhi, which covers the first election (and some important subsequent elections) I'd add Ruchir Sharma's **Democracy on the Road: A 25 Year Journey through India** to this list. \n\nFrom the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns. It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election. Quite funny/eye-opening/shocking at various points, as  they talk to everyone from Maoists to RSS to swing voters. They also talk to basically every major politician of the last 2 decades while on the campaign trail.",

Looks like you have to be a sycophantic stooge to hare-brained disasters like demonetization and and prove your jingoism credentials to get sanctified by the Saffron league.\n\nAnybody that actually still believes that the BJP is the free-market fiscally conservative party is either ignorant or lying. Just another run of the mill bureaucrat from mudi administration Rubberstamp Das a PhD in brown-nosing from PakodeBecho University.   But he's best qualified for the job of emptying RBI coffers for kaka's election victory in 2019. But Shaktikanta Das is PhD in agreeing with the PM.",

The timings are tough - 9 am to 7 pm Mon-Fri. 9 am to 3 pm on Saturdays. I get paid only 55k. But most importantly, this is a dead end job. There is a stagnation in learning and earning after a few years. My manager with an experience of 18 years earns only 130k a month.\n\nI am planning to self-teach web development. I do not come from a technical background. I did my undergrad in BBA in Finance. \n\nIs it possible to switch careers at this age? Is it possible to get jobs in Singapore, Hong Kong or other countries as a self-taught web developer?\n\nAnother option is to keep doing this job while freelance as a web developer. Is this possible?",

You definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to take.\n\nMBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.\n\nYou have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet. If you want to study in India, ISB is one such option. Do you hold a Thai passport? If yes, look into getting into the IIMs via the foreign student route. Much easier to get in than through the regular CAT Tell me which Indian dude gets paid 15L per annum like you are, at the age of 24? Guys with your qualification in india earn 1/5th of what you earn. Since you’ve saved 10L until now, which is a great amount of money for your age, you can do an MBA and a PGDM from a **top ranked university** under NRI quota for that amount. You’ll need a good number of years put aside for that, and then you’ll get jobs that pay above 10LPA in the beginning. After that, the sky’s the limit. I think you already earn well enough, and really don’t need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job. The Thailand govt cares about their country more than India does and I think you’ll earn really well staying there instead of coming to India. Lady boi ban ja. ",

    "body" : "Hi Everyone,\n\nI browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.\n\nA little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.\n\nI had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.\n\nI met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.\n\nWe tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!\n\nThanks,\n\nAblahnaari!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "comment" : " Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.\n* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. \n* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.\n* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.\n* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and \"society\". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.\n* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.\n\nI wish you all the best!\n  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don’t hold him back.\n\nAs for you, you are too young to be worried about what’s gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what’s in store. \n\nThat ablanaari shit was funny though 😊 >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head\n\nStop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.\n\nBut my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.\n You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. \n\nLPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.\n\nlive life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. \n\n*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. \n\nOr if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.\n\nAs for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died. You probably already know the 5 stages of grief. You are going to go through all of it, not in sequence but in circles. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrust me I went through this, Im not out yet .. but I am a million times better than what I was immediately after.  curious question... is the word 'abla' or 'ablah'? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add 'h' around their 'T's but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is abla\n\nthankhs.",

Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I’ll just add some information to help you make your decision:\nEntry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. \n If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.\n\nSimilarly, \"an online business\" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. \n\nIf I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.\n You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?\n\nIf you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. \n\nThe problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.\n\nJewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. \nOne option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.\n\nSo sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?\n\nthere are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.\n\nNot saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with.",

    "body" : "You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?\n\n>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.\n\n>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.\n\n>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.\n\nYou’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.\n\n>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States\n\n>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.\n\n>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.\n\n>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.\n\n>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.\n\nWhy didn’t States raise the issue?\n\n>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.\n\n>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.\n\n>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.\n\nAren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…\n\n>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.\n\n>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.\n\n>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.\n\n>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.\n\n>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.\n\n>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used\n\n>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.\n\nSo the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?\n\n>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.\n\n>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.\n\nYou mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?\n\n>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.\n\nIs it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?\n\n>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.\n\nThere is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?\n\n>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.\n\n>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.\n\n>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.\n\n>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.\n\nWhat’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?\n\n>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?\n\n>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.\n\nIsn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?\n\n>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.\n\nCan this be replicated in other areas?\n\n>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.\n\n>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.\n\nIs that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?\n\n>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.\n\n>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.\n\n>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.\n\nPleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.\n\n>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.\n\n>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.\n\nOn the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?\n\n>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.\n\n>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.\n\n>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.\n\nCess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?\n\n>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.\n\nIsnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...\n\n>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.\n\nYou have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?\n\n>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.\n\n>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.\n\n>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.\n\nHow much is this because of a strong leader at the top?\n\n>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.\n\nIn 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?\n\n>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.\n\n[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)",

I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).\n\nNot bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhere's my work environment.\n\ni want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.\n\ni'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy queries are\n\n1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.\n2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\\*\\*\\*\\* hain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[EDIT\\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? \n\n&#x200B;\n\ndo i need a manufacturers licence ?",

Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.\n\nNo you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.\n\n>do i need to pay rent to parents.\n\nUp to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)\n\n>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.\n\nNO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job\n\n>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.\n\nNO\n\n>do i need current account.\n\nIt is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k \n\nIf you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me.  You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. \n\nGet sales first. Everything comes after that. \n\nJust make sure to not make your dad a director in the company (pvt ltd). Government employees can't be directors in private companies Good luck mate!\n I am very curious about your product and I hope you will post an update about it once you launch it. All the best. You need to give more information. \n\nWhat is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? \n\nWho are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.\n\nThe answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? \n\nSince your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.\n\nBut again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. \n\nIf you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)\n Bhai best of luck I wish you all the best. I can't answer your question as I am a salaried professional..\n\nBut I'd like an update once things start rolling for you.\n\nKeep us updated.\n\nCheers!  [deleted] how useful is your inventions, what scale do you think you can see your invention is going to be used/sold/made.\n\nwhere in the world do you see your invention being used? If you're even slightly suspicious about the advantage your invention has in a country, I'd suggest you go there and apply for a patent. The chinese would definitely give fuckall respect to your patent and will clone it anyways.\n\nrent a commercial place and move your business into that.",

BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.\n\nWe have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.\n\nI am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'\n\nWhile all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.\n\nAll these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!\n\nI do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.\n\nA rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.\n\nSo yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.\n\nI am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.\n\nLastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",

    "body" : "# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.\n&nbsp;\n\nAll your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.\n\nAnd now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. \n\nBut don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.\n\nBefore you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. \n\n&nbsp;\n##### Savings are sexy\nLet's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Debt is your kryptonite\nSo you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Read like your life depends on it\nStop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Gold is old\nGold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Insurance =/= Investing\nWhile housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Real estate is not real investing\nThe only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Pick your poison properly\nIdentifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Get yourself into a coma\nThe best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Don't watch CNBC\nAll your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.\n\n&nbsp;\n##### Keep It Simple, Shithead\nHere is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:\n \n|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |\n|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |\n| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |\n \nWhen you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? \n\nThe lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.\n\nAlways keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\nSide note: If you're a housewife from the 70s or 80s who objects to your characterization in this article, please write a formal letter of complaint and [shove it up your butt](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/btt.gif).\n\n",

    "comment" : " Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:\n\n* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.\n* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.\n* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.\n* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.\n* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.\n* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.\n* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. \n* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.\n* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.\n* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.\n* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.\n* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.\n* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.\n* Investing is not rocket science.

    "body" : "Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \\] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",

    "comment" : " Glad your family situation is better.  Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? \n\nAny degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA.  Bhai get back your career on track.\nThe best thing you could do to support your family. How old are you now ?\n\nWhat do you do for a living ?\n\n\n First, go to Mumbai right away to collect your documents from the college!\n\nSecond, take it as a fresh start. If you are not sure of B.Com, think of some other option. If you are concerned about the time wasted, you could perhaps enroll for a correspondence program from IGNOU until the next academic year? Dude, from your replies, I notice you're 20. So, first off you have time on your side - LOADS of it! That's a good thing.\n\nNow coming to your conundrum, I understand you may be anxious to share it with some admin guy in your college.  However, if it helps you re-secure your place in the college, I'd say it's worth it. However, you have to be prepared for the worst case scenario that they may not take you back. So you gotta keep your options open.\n\nFinally, yes [B.Com](https://B.Com). is worth it. However, IF you can do, I'd suggest doing something in Economics. If you do well in Economics, there usually are good opportunities, including scholarships for Masters. Just by 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you have any further questions. ",

I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers.

They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few.

The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.\n\nNew Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now.

    "comment" : " > 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? \n\ndepends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? \n\nPlease go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??\n\nagain, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? \n\nI'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. \n\nCleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? \n\nnot sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? \n\nmost big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? \n\nPlease search \"canada express entry\" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. \n\nThere are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has \"pleasant\" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.\n\n&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.\n\nHere are my responses:\n\n> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.\n\n$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. \n\n> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???\n\nWork permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.\n\n> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??\n\nIf you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.\n\n> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???\n\nI don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather\n\n> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.\n\nBenefits:\n- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.\n\n> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??\n\nNot sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.\n\n> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??\n\nAbsolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.\n\n> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?\n\n Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).\n\n> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???\n\nEvery small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.\n\n> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??\n\nTry express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.\n\n> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?\n\nPlease don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.\n\nI don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.\n\n> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.\n\nPleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.\n\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*\n- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.\n- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.\n\nPM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don’t like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. \n\nAs someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice. \n\nI say go ahead and don’t look back. Negotiate everything but don’t look back.  Bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? Culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh kar😂\n\nAnd the society there is different. So be prepared that Indian way of thinking needs to be changed. \n\nWeather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat.  It's not worth it. You shall suffer from the lack of food, a familiar natural environment, social life et cetera. Really not a good decision.",

Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. \n\nSomeone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help?

    "body" : "Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).\n\nFor example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.\n\nSo, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.\n\nHowever, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. \n\nSo, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.\n\nBigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.\n\nThe AR's could be like that:\n\n1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.\n\n2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.\n\n3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.\n\n4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.\n\n5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.\n\n6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.\n\n7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.\n\nLet's debate.\n",

    "comment" : " I didn't read the whole thing cause I'm super sleepy but larger states must be broken, especially UP. It's easier to govern, it's easier to decentralise the power one or a few states hold in national elections, and it gets easier to carry out govt welfare programmes and other schemes, and people can be equally have a larger voice when it comes to holding the system accountable. Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc. Playing the devil’s advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state? I know it seems intuitive, but is that the only factor we should consider? What are the factors that are really holding back growth on our states? If every thing else remained constant and we only reduced the size, would we see a better result?",

Nobody has literally any control over the supreme court. It is the most opaque arm of our state, always has been. Stop blaming random shit on modi, your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this. Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn’t since the time of Indira Gandhi?\n\nModi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.\n\nI don’t like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. \nAnd why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.\n\nAlso, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.\n\nWhat factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.\n\nTechnically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.\n\nI am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - \"My father, let my country be led to ruin\" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions. I read somewhere that corruption in India really kicked off with Indira Gandhi, precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors/allies",

    "comment" : " Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.\n\nOn the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA \n\nMany of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. \n\nMy friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).\n\nThey were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.\n\nThe fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! \n\n(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a \"transfer\" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an \"MBA\" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business? CAT 18 aspirant here(not serious as per now), currently studying in an average engineering college. \n\n80% chances that I will be placed in a mass recruiting company. \n\nMS from abroad or MBA from India, as a fresher.? Don't downvote, ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life (the reason abroad). I belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education. Hows fore and symbiosis? Which was your MBA institution? ",

    "comment" : " I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.\n\nIMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. \n\nI hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam\n\nIITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to \"learn more\". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. \n\nLlb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.\n\nWhile studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.\n\nI believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age\n\nNot sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.\n\nEasy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.\n\nAn area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. \n\nThe best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.\n\n*For preparation of CLAT, u may suggest this free CLAT mock test site - https://www.cybermocktest.com/clat/*  If he already has masters degree why doesn't he just take a NET exam and teach? Law undergrad student from NLU Patiala, here.\n\nI’m sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.\n5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.\nIt’s a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.\n\nI would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.\n Never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goal.\n\n\nHe'd just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check.",

Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.

Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows.

High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state.

And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014.

    "comment" : " Damn you OP, I was expecting some mallu models\n\n(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI\n\nYou may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.\n\nTheir economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.\n\nThe debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.\n\nNow let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. \n\nAnd why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .\n\n\nFor Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. \n\nTrade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.\n\nI really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. \n\nThe fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. \n\nMy main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. \n\nBut regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala’s economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. \n\nKerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.\n\nThe reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.\n\nBy arguing that Kerala’s economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.\n\nNobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. \n\nIs it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn’t seem like it. \n\nHas historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. \n\nNow, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. \n\nKerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. \n\nAlso some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  \n\n\nAnd to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. \n\nIt is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. \n\nSo, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. \n\nSo, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely. \n The riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokku_kooli\n\nOne of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard of.",

It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. \n\nSo here we go\n\n* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. \n\n* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna\n\n* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.\n\n* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important\n\n* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.\n\n* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities\n\n* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship \n\n* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.\n\n* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. \n\n* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. \n\n* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat\n\n* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action\n\n* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. \n\n* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** \n\n* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.\n\n* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.\n\n* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**\n\n* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. \n\n* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)\n\n* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) \n\n* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.\n\nRamdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. \n\nFinally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.\n\nEdit 1: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",

I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.\n\n**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)\n\nIt's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief. Even before reading this, I never trusted in Ramdev as a spiritual godman, but still didn't actively disapprove of him since I just considered him to be a businessman.\nBut reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gullible.\n\nThanks for the post mate. You have completely changed my perception.\n\nTL;DR. \"New shit has come to light.\" I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.\n\nFor example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not. This is fucking scary man... Fuck! OP, this is great. I had always known there was something behind Rajeev Dixit's death. \n\nJust like he says to boycott Chinese goods, I think we should all boycott Patanjali goods.  Gangs of Wasseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh kar.\n\nThis is scary AF side of this FMCG empire.\n So as expected, this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies, deceit and murders.\n\nThank you OP. Somebody need to make a hindi TLDR. thanks for the summary, was looking for a kindle version and couldn't find. great that you pointed to the app by Juggernaut.",

After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\n\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\n\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\n\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\n\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\n\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\n\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\n\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\n\nLet's begin with the Mughals\n\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\n\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\n\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\n\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\n\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\n\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\n\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18 century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\n\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\n\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\n\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\n\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\n\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\n\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\n\nIndia begins to re-industrize\n\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\n\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\n\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\n\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\n\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\n\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\n\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\n\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\n\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\n\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\n\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\n\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\n\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\n\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\n\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\n\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\n\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\n\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\n\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\n\nIndia after the Reforms\n\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\n\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\n\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\n\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\n\nSome lessons\n\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\n\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\n\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\n\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\n\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\n\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\n\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\n\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\n\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\n\nDoes culture matter?\n\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\n\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\n\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\n\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\n\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\n\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\n\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\n\n\n",

    "comment" : " Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an \"evil\" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  \n\nIMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding \"India\" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.\n\nYes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a \"Indian\" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. \n\nThe drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the \"gifts\" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.\n\nA book came out last year called \"Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830\" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. \n\nHe makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. \n >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. \n\nI'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice \"peaceful.\" Have read the whole thing.\nThe Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.\n\nTaking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.\n\nThis they did by creating:\nLow literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)\n\nUnstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.\n\nPersonally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch.",

You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  \n  \nIf the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  \n  \n**Science & Technology** \n\nThis flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it.

Does no math.\n\n**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**\n\nA look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. \n\nWhile Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).\n\nThe author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.\n\n>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.\n\nHas the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. \n\n###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:\n\nWe are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.\n\nSince the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. \n\n^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)\n\nOver 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.\n\nSo effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**\n\n###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:\n\nAssuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.\n\nBut seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. \n\n###Still don't get it? Okay try this: \n\nHere's a real-life example using real data from the past:\n\n* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)\n* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).\n\nLet's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.\n\nSay your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.\n\nNow, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).\n\nMeanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.\n\nSo your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.\n\nNow obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. \n\n###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). \n\n^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)\n\nThis is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. \n\nPut another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. \n\nIf you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)\n\nSo... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. \n\nNow, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.\n\nYes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.\n\nThis, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.\n\n________________________________\n\n###But wait! There's more:\n\n\n>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.\n\n>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.\n\n>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.\n\n> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.\n\n^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)\n\nThey want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.\n\nThe article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.\n\n\n    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years\n    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years\n    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.\n\nBasically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).\n\nSo averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. \n\n    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.\n\n1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? \n\n###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. \n\nLet's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. \n\n[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. \n\nThat leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. \n\n**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**\n\n###Wait, what?! \n\n*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* \n\nI dunno! Let's check: \n\n* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. \n* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.\n* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. \n\nHot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in \"operational costs\" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.\n\nWho in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.\n\n###DO THE MATH",

    "comment" : " Reposting from my earlier comment:\n\nBloombergQuint explains it well here:\n\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill\n\nELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?\n\n* Do a bail out. \n* Do a bail in. \n* Go bankrupt and close down. \n\nThe point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. \n\nWith great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. \n\nNow imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?\n\nWith a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. \n\nWith a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. \n\nNote: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. \n\nNow comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. \n\nSo what has changed in this law? Two things:\n\n* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. \n* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. \n\nWhat changes for you because of this law:\n\n* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. \n\n* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. \n\nEither way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application.  Because it is pointless fear mongering.\n\nWe had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?\n\nYou lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.\n\nThe Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.\n\nThe matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.\n\nSeriously, what do you think the laws are today?\n\n So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs? Because baa baa black sheep,have you any fools?\n\n\nYes sir,yes sir,one country full. This is extremely scary. Banks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential. They default and to cover the bank's losses, the depositers also take a 'hair cut'. For the money they forego, they are given equity in the bank which in most cases, will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in 'bail in'. Same thing happened in Cyprus Bhaiyya bail out aur bail in nahi, gau out or gau in. Hamar dau dau bachiya hai. Kuch saal baad gau ban jaayi. Because There is no provision of cancellation of Deposits. 'Bail In' exempts Deposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of Insurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe. Bail In is the last resort to get you the money Depositors and Creditors apart from ₹100000 insurance money. As usual media is peddling fake news. Modi will leave us only after sucking us off every penny we have , kuch chutiya admi hain bhai  Earlier the insurance was 1 lakh, today its 0...  not all that different in the larger scale I feel",

    "body" : "NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.\n\n\"The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.\n\nGlobalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).\n\nThe result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.\"\n\n\nPANAMA: No questions asked!\n\nThe ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.\n\nPanama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.\n\nPanama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.\n\nPanama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.\n\nWhy do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.\nTo comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?\n\nWhen an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.\n\nA good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.\n\nThe fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?\n\nThe list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.\n\nOf the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?\n\nThe UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.\n\nAccording to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?\nThis is where the Panama’s of the world come in. \n\nThere was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.\n\nCredit: Mohan G",

Yr ek baat btao itne bade bade posts tum log likh kaise lete ho, mujhse toh padhe nhi jaate. Does anyone have the data dump of the panama papers?? Tax avoidance and Tax evasion are completely different thing. One is legal and another is illegal. Add to that the names are big so PR management companies can easily shut up any news outlet by threatening to remove the ads(by celebrity and company, nobody wants bad press). I also blame Indian Express, the reporting is shoddy and there is very narrow reach. Add to that the Newspaper is in English, the number of readers are way less than any other newspaper​.

At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. \n\nYou could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.\n\nThe thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.\n\nPeople are opening up to MOOC degree based recruitment but it's not going to be easy OP. But good luck :) Didn't mean to put your spirits down but be prepared to work really hard at 30 to get a job. Does the family business make money or lose money?

    "comment" : " One of the Best places from India. For a goan in Chennai it was as close as it get to being like Home. I visited Pondi last year. It's such a peaceful place. Everyone seems laid back.   \n\nChilling with people on the promenade along Rock Beach at 3 AM while both drunk and slightly stoned is one of the best experiences I've had.  Come visit us! Pondicherry is lovely this time of the Year!  Well planned roads, cheap booze, plenty of beaches, very close to Chennai, French grils ❤️ Moved out of Pondicherry a couple of years ago and this posts makes me miss home. Very peaceful to come visit. Especially right now. Go to the different beaches. Enjoy the architecture. Go to Auroville and smoke a blunt. Go to the Ashram and Matrimandir and get some peace. Take a bike and roam in the \"white town\" at 6 in the morning. And also, don't forget your alcohol.\nTry out different restaurants in the evening and Nehru St and Mission St for all your shopping. If you are there on Sunday, do go to the Sunday Market on MG road. \n\nIf you are driving, do fill up your tanks and also more in a storage. Cheapest rates IMO.\n\nEDIT\n\n\nFun fact: When I mention white town, it is called the boulevard. The heart of Pondicherry. Was built by the French(duh). They have an amazing drainage system with two canals one going north-south and other east to west. The north South Canal also separates the white town from the regular town(The french were racists). The french lived in the white town next to the beach and the rest on the west. The french also constructed roads and all the east to west roads are parallel to each other and end at the beach. \nThe regular town was also divided by the french based on religion. The north was full of Hindus and that is where you will find the old temples. The south was Christians. You will find beautiful churches and missionary schools. The South east was Muslims. Their roads are the unique roads in pondicherry where they don't end up in the beach but are diagonal and face the Mecca. There is a Pondicherry Arch at all the three borders when you enter Pondicherry. And also, two clock towers at the focii of the boulevard. Oh forgot to mention it is in the form of an [ellipse](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Puducherry/@11.9322492,79.8217652,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a5361ab8e49cfcf:0xcc6bd326d2f0b04e!8m2!3d11.9138598!4d79.8144722). A lot of people in Chennai use Puducherry as a weekend getaway to binge but Puducherry has so much more to offer. There is some charm in taking a walk on those cobbled streets, going to Auroville  or Matrimandir.I have spent a lot of Sundays on those beaches reading a book. I used to finish entire novels there. In the evening, go to one of those restaurants and eat a sumptuous meal with a beer. Le Club was absolutely amazing. An evening walk on the beach with a  bit of sweat dripping from your head which the wind tries to soothe.\n\nThank you for the memories Puducherry and thank you for providing a much needed quick escape from the chaos of corporate life. Also, you get to see French chicks in salwars. I don't know the intricacies, but the desi cloth definitely makes them 10/10s.  How's Kiran Bedi's performance till date?

The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)\n\nNot many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.\n\nThis decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future.

The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media \"tones\" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. \n\nA worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. \n\nTwo factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. \n\nIts getting scarier and worsened. \n\n\nA simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get \"CHIP and PIN\" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. \n\nEdit 1: In response to \"proofs\" and so called \"click bait\"; here are the links. Please connect the dots. \nFurther, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-) \n1) https://hacked.com/phishing-malware-strikes-one-largest-private-banks-india/ \n2) http://www.zdnet.com/article/malware-targets-indias-largest-private-bank/\n3) http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/axis-bank-appoints-ey-to-probe-cyber-attack-report_7647221.html\n4) http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/cyber-attack-on-union-banks-offshore-accounts-2930681/\n5) http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Security-breach-SBI-blocks-over-6L-debit-cards/articleshow/54926828.cms\n6) http://www.medianama.com/2016/10/223-axis-bank-and-sbi-hacks-security/\n\nI think it's objective proof enough.

[removed] >Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp)\n\nHow? Do they hack Whatsapp or whatsapp willingly just hand over user data(which is bread and butter of FB) to any wannabe ?\n\nFor reference - https://www.eff.org/node/82654\n\n I work in a company which  has largest market share in banking software. These products assist banks to maintain security, DB, financial rules like BASEL and many other things.I work in RDBMS and big data maintenance along with cloud encryption. So, let me tell you a thing or two on how this system works.\n\nFirst of all, simply by knowing your phone number using whatsapp will not be sufficient to hack a bank. It's like throwing a pebble on a lion at some kung-fu nerve and hoping to kill it. It's ridiculous so I will not even justify discussing this here because it's not quora and assume people over here to just use their logic a little. \n\nNow let us assume discussion is about hacking an individual's bank account, phishing is the most reliable way to do it. But be always aware to check if the website you have opened is https or not. It is a very basic thing. **NEVER OPEN LINKS USING YOUR MAIL ACCOUNT.** Phishing basically fools you to think that you are logging in to a bank but it is a private page of a hacker and you are basically texting him your password by typing over there. Now any hacker can easily deceive google security by making a hash code which he can crack easily so you wouldn't be notified by google too that this page is a security risk. Then there are other ways too. OTPs come on your phone and in more than a few cases, locked phones prompts the message on screen and OTP can be seen from that screen. This wouldn't be hacking but more like theft. **This btw is the best and to my knowledge the only way to hack into your friend's facebook account**. There are other ways too but phishing is the most common. It is like a king's pawn opening with many varities of its own. Usually a hacker develops his own way to phish but in 99% of the cases that involves sending you a mail and you opening a link through it or using your intranet or VPN to deceive the router.\n\n>Indian banking system under attack!\n\nThis headline though is not about individual attacks on users but about an attack on a bank itself i.e. injecting your malware in their servers to redirect you to phishing or anywhere from bank's servers directly. It is very much possible for high end hackers but they will be caught by the system easily. One of my company's software provide three layers of security after authentication which is almost impossible to break. Other products provide microservices to enhance security over different modules. Banks hire other firms solely to enhance security and have their own departments to enhance it even more. Banks have multiple servers and their multiple back ups in multiple locations through which data traverse while your authentication happens. So physically hacking a server may get you past first layer but not other layers. Now using cyber attacks to go past all the servers is very very very tough. It's like landing on moon tough. ~~Countries who have that capability can do that~~ Then again, their are people with advanced brains and skills who dream of owning an island so theoretically they also might do it.  But a malware which redirects you to a different webpage through a bank's server is also possible but would be detected in milliseconds. Such a malware can remain in system to attack for that 1 millisecond for a few times but then again transactions are extremely hard to do even after knowing your passwords because banks detects IP jumps, have OTP verification process, have card grids any many other ways to ensure transaction is done by you and not by someone else.\n\nTL;DR  : Even if someone puts a malware in a bank which is **extremely tough** and that easily detectable, he might get an idea of your bank balance but he can't do transactions. These are mostly rumors to shake stock markets by targeting those non-technical, superstitious and no chicken on Tuesday stock dealers.\n\nKnowledge nugget: Start using Kali linux if you feel like hacking into your friend's computers and using their webcams and microphones. Start with creating word document with a listener and mailing it to your friend and ensuring that he opens the attachment. You will start making your own ways once you get addicted to it. Edit: OP has made some effort to actually try and substantiate his position, while several other comment threads are on random threats you can face online.\n\nFirstly to OP, good on you for focus. \n\nAs to why this doesnt count as proof - \n\nArticles 1 and 2, both link to articles on the same phishing attacks being targeted at ICICI users \n\nArticle 3, talks about \n\n> India's third-largest private-sector bank Axis Bank   has appointed auditing firm EY to probe a cyber attack that came to its notice last month, a report in the Economic Times  says.\n\n> The ET report said Axis was contacted by an engineer from Moscow-based Kaspersky anti-virus firm who told the bank that he had discovered a bug in Axis' systems while carrying out a separate probe. The bank has filed a report with the Reserve Bank of India appraising it of the situation. \n\nFirstly, if you are bringing E&Y to check your code... well, now you have 2 problems. (3, KASPERSKY has gotten in touch with you, and someone decides to go with E&Y? Wtf?)\n\nThere is something more material in that article here: \n>In June this year, the Reserve Bank of India had formulated a comprehensive policy that it wants banks to roll out. The guidelines outline an indicative set of baseline cyber security and resilience requirements,  steps to set up a \"cyber security operation centre\" and a template for reporting incidents to the central bank\n\nBut again, this is not proof that there is an Attack on the Indian banking system. Suggestive, but also business as normal for people to create and implement policy and security improvements.\n\nArticle 4 - \n> Public sector Union Bank of India on Friday said one of the bank’s offshore accounts was breached in a cyber attack but the money trail was traced and movement of funds was blocked.\n\nAgain, the fact that banks are targeted is not new. If there were multiple attempts to physically rob banks we would say theres a *spree* of bank robberies. Not that there is an attack on the banking system. You would have to prove that all these attacks are linked and designed to damage/bring down the Indian banking system.\n\n\nFinally - theres 2 articles on security breaches. Sadly they happen. But again, bad net sec does not an attack make.\n\n\nAgain, extraordinary claims, extraordinary proof. You have to show that there is a sustained, organized and directed attack on the Indian Banking system. Not that Indian banks have still to improve their security.\n\n \n------------\nWth?\n\nDude, proof or gtfo. For this to be an issue you would need to have a fraudulent transaction rate Increase across all banks.\n\nThis is something checked on a daily basis and if there was a rise or a spike, it would be an issue discussed or raised elsewhere.\n\nYou are making an implicit accusation and an explicit one.\n\n1) Indian banking system is under attack\n\n2) since it is being attacked and no one is aware about it, people checking errors and fraud are either zombies or sweeping it under the rug or are not bringing it to the authorities \n\nEither claim is extraordinary and for extraordinary claims there needs to be extraordinary proof.\n\nProvide the proof.\n\n  Seems like a forwarded WhatsApp spam message.\n Awareness about skimmers, Phishing, Vishing is the key. End user is too naive to understand this. As a security professional I took it as my personal responsibility to make my friends & family members aware about secure practices while using cards offline or online, while using social media & while browsing internet & about how to identify & avoid suspicious emails. Chip + PIN is not entirely safe. I posted here few weeks back about an incident where ₹ 20k were withdrawn from my account using a debit card at an ATM in a different city whereas the card was with me all the time. Luckily the bank (HDFC) credited the amount back in around 3 weeks, which is great but not sure if every other bank does it. To add when this happened, a bank official told me this has been happening with many people of late so I think some fuck up has happened with our banking system. Only option is to use cash now or keep your account balance low till it gets better, which I don't know how or when is gonna get.  Its actually not that hard to prevent you from reading smses from banks. You dont even need to fake an ID to do that\n\nYou can get an sms bomber for as cheap as 5 dollars and Call bomber for 10 dollars.\n\nPoint being, If a fraudster already has your bank details there is very little you can do to protect yourself. So get yourself the chip + pin cards like op says to better protect yourself. Source? As a security engineer I would like to spend extra million dollars to put few cisco NAC appliances next to firewall. Also will be strict allowing thumb drives on any bank peripherals. \n\nI wil put all windows xp machines behind secondary  firewall, they are very easy to hack in to while upgrading any windows servers that are still windiws 2000.\n\n",

Under AEBAS, the teachers should register with ktzpshivamogga.attendance.gov.in, the webportal of the Zilla Panchayat formed to monitor the attendance. After registration, a login ID and password would be provided for the user. The ID would be the first six or the last six digits of the Aadhaar number of the employee. After accessing the portal through the login ID, the attendance should be registered by entering the biometric information which will be authenticated by matching it with the data stored in the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) database. \n\n**June 14, 2016:** You might soon require an [Aadhaar card to file police complaints in Maharashtra.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/Soon-youll-need-Aadhaar-card-for-police-complaint/articleshow/52753151.cms?)

How are they allowed to do these *other* things?\n___\n\nThere has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. \n\nBut alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [\"Take out the Trash\" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.\n\n*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*\n\n**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**\n\nAye. That can be done. \n\nThere is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled \"Power of Authority to make Regulations\" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.\n\n[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)\n\n[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)\n\n\nLook at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:\n\n- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)\n\n- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)\n\n- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)\n\n- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)\n\nAll of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does \"other purposes\" even mean?!\n\nI have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.\n\nBut... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?\n\n___\n#What can we do about it now?\n___\nWell, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  \n\nUnless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. \n\nIf the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.\n\n\nI will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:\n\n#“CONSTANT VIGILANCE!”\n___\n\nFin.\n\nEDIT: Added a link to a detailed post on the Aadhaar Bill and its various provisions.",

    "comment" : " I don't like where this is going. A biometric way of identification should be implemented to protect one's identity, not be given to MNCs who can invent ways to isolate people based on their unique identification. \n\nWhy are bills and laws being passed with vague terminology and wording? The largest democracy in the world is proving to be the most retarded democracy in protecting its own people and their interests. \n\nEven after such loopholes are discovered and exposed, the Supreme Court is just sitting on its ass and not doing anything to correct the flawed system. If such an attitude is displayed by the highest authority of the country, why do we even respect the institution named \"Supreme Court\"??!! To be more precise, what respect does the Supreme Court exhibit towards the common man??? I used to be one of the \"meh, why such a ruckus about Aadhar's biometrics\", but I must say, this shit is truly scary now. Orwellian seems to be the word.\n\nStuff like Iris enabled tabs are still in their early stages and cost might be a factor, but a decade from now, a govt could do whatever it wants with this.\n\nAlso that rule about FIR's is fucking silly. Assume I get mugged, how in fuck am I supposed to remember my Aadhar card number? Retarded shit. Do we have Right to Privacy though? \n\nArticle 21 says : No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\n\nAny lawyers who can clear up please? Most people here have not deciphered the government's game plan on Aadhar. Basically, it wants to side step and push until one can get it via underhanded tactics. So, technically it might not be required but they will push it as they know courts have a high turn around time. By then, they would have achieved their REAL objective - mass collection of  data.\n [deleted] awesome writeup. govt is trying their best to shove aadhar down our throats. looks like soon i'm going to be deprived of basic amenities because i lack Aadhar card (proliferation in Bengal is not much still) I did not want to make aadhar account. But then I was forced to because my new employer, an US based MNC, made it mandatory.\n\nIs it legal for foreign based companies to ask for you aadhar card? I am not able to wrap my head around this issue, so guys help me here please. \n\n**Identification** - OP and others have given examples of Aadhaar being required for authentication and identification in various scenarios. Things like, FIR, Attendance, Skype calls with Govt, deliverance of government services and subsidies etc. \n\nAt the basic level we all know for a fact that identification is required for all these things. \n\nNow why is Aadhar number & card (as a proof od identity and residence) worse than pan-card, license, passport, ration-card, electricity-bill, phone-bill, bpl card, bank statement etc? \n\nIf just one single card/identification-proof works for most-things (where we need identification/authentication) why is it bad?\n\nIs it an issue with us being **forced**? Like there is no compulsion to own/have any of the identifications like pan-card etc, I mentioned above, but we are indirectly being pushed to have Aadhar cards? \n\nBut there again for various stuff we have been forced to get these cards. Like a pan-card is not compulsory in theory but becomes so when you start earning. Or a passport, license, ration-card under different circumstances. \n\n**Biometrics** - It eases the authorization/identification and reduces the chances of frauds and scams. mobile banking transactions might actually become more secure with these. \n\n**Misuse**- This is a concern which is very valid. But how and under what circumstances? Are we looking at real threats or just far-fetched fiction?\n\n**Methodologies adopted by the govt** - As the OP mentioned that the way Aadhar Bill was passed and there is clause which can enable the govt to make changes aren't really kocher. However, aren't we mixing up the two things. What's done and how it got done are two different subjects. Wrong way does not make Aadhar itself wrong. \n\nHappy to change my opinion. Is there an NGO where I can donate which would fight against Aadhaar in Supreme Court? I will not take Aadhaar unless the SC says there is no way out. > other purposes\n\n> other technology safeguards\n\nSo, I bothered checking out section 23.\n\nSubsection 1 puts execution of process of issue completely in the \"authority's\" hands.\n\nClause (t) of subsection 2 goes like this --\n>(t) such other powers and functions as may be prescribed.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me? So the existing govt can do whatever the hell it wants with UID data.\n\nAll hell breaks loose if something open to interpretation like \"other\" creeps into contract or tender documents. Too bad we don't subject legislative bills to same standards. will resists getting this card as much as posible, lets see how long we can survive",

    "body" : "I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).\n\nBackground:\n\nA bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.\n\nI recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.\n\nI have two options to choose from:\n\n**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**\n\nI have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.\n\nMy one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.\n\nAlmost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.\n\nIn the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.\n\nBesides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.\n\nWhile living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. \n \n**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**\n\nI mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.\n\nRegarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",

    "comment" : " Stay in nederdraad. Visit once twice a year. You won't regret long term.  It's at such times only that you have to decide your priorities in life, and develop and follow your principles. I personally believe in this - \"The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships\". A poor person can be quite happy if surrounded by people he loves. A very rich man will not be happy without loved ones.\n\nThat said, things are more complicated. Employment and infrastructure is bad in India. And it's not always that our family or relationships will be good. So you have to decide whether things are worth it.\n\nOne idea probably is to work in your prime years abroad, earn a shitload of money, marry a desi import or someone okay with moving to India, save your money, and return to India in time for your kids to go to college. And retire here. All the while visiting as much as you can, to keep in touch with family and also making arrangements for your future.\n\nOr another one is to take the leap of faith, return to your motherland, try and work to do your bit to improve this country, and save your wife and kids the trauma of moving.\n\nStaying there, you will always remain an outsider. And so will your kids, be them desi or mixed race. I wouldn't want that for my children. Family sticks when no one will. Your 'friends' and 'neighbours' won't take care of you when you're​ sick or grow old. I am in no way expert, but try to earn as much as possible there and then move back as the other guy said. Buy everything you need here while working there (car, house, maybe savings for marriage and kids) and then find a job here before moving back. It will be rough but smoothen it out with money.\n\nIs there any possibility that your parents can fly over to Netherlands for maybe 2-3 months in-between for just traveling and will ease the homesickness while allowing them to also enjoy?\n\n Stay. With family it's \"door ki cheez sona, pass ki cheez chapal.\" , your value diminishes as long as you be with your family. Catch 22.\nBased on my experience, I still have not found any answer to this question.\nBut stay in ND till you find a way out. Seems your mind says Netherlands, but your heart says India. FWIW, the software industry in India has improved over the last few years. There is considerable foreign investment in the market right now and if you display your skills well, you can make comparable money. Also, years of interacting with the west and many NRIs coming back has resulted in some of that culture rubbing off. If you know where to look for, you will find places that value employee well being as a means to overall productivity. Keep away from the big four obviously. I think you should stay there. \n&nbsp;\n\nYou have mentioned that you can fly your mother there but there is no one to look after you siblings? But you also mentioned that your sibling(s) are about to graduate? I think they can manage staying alone for a couple of weeks. \n&nbsp;\n\nTalk to them about it. And later, they can accompany your mum too! I'm not sure if I'm the right guy for this, but you should ask yourself instead of strangers. 100 people will give 100 different answers. Ultimately you are responsible for your own life. Don't leave NL or stay there just because 90% of the subreddit says so. Its your life and you alone should make the choice. Nobody here has any idea of your thoughts, beliefs, values etc. Personally I would quit my comforts to live with my family regardless of them giving me any bhaw or not. Its because I love them. I would do that. But that doesn't mean you should too. Flip a coin, while its in the air, the result you hope for is the correct choice. As for a personal opinion, money and good lifestyle can only get you so far. The ultimate thing is being happy inside. And if being with your family makes you happy, then by all means return to your country. It doesn't matter if you've got a villa, a swimming pool and a fuckload of money with 2 yr leave,if you're lonely. If you want to be with your family and it seems like you do take them there or move back home. Its all upto you. Good luck brother. Please do update someday what you did.  Come back to live with your family and make India progress with your incredible talent.  Could you not try and set up your own business from the Netherlands and when this runs well enough move it to India? Software engineering can be done anywhere? \nI am from the Netherlands, I adopted my daughter from India. Since politician Wilders is spouting his hatred she also has a harder time. I am not sure where this will end. Sometimes I fear that Muslims will be the new Jews in another 10 years or so. (My daughters biological parents were most likely Hindu, by the way) Visit often or get your family to Netherlands",

Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. \n\nAustralia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. \n\nMeanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with \"chit funds\" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. \n\nAnd Im not talking about middle men like \"Zebpay\" and \"Unocoin\" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. \n\nWe are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.\n\n\nMake no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin.

Ok, I'll bite. \n\n> Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming.\n\nSure they have. But is it illegal in India or USA ? If tomorrow Amazon decides that it will accept payments in Gold , Bitcoins or any legal doohickeys , can they prosecute Amazon ?

So lets never use them till each BTC is worth a gazillion kabillion dollars.\n\n> ...middle men like \"Zebpay\" and \"Unocoin\" ...\n\nHow in the fricking hell do you think an average Amit in India or an average Joe in Europe will be buying a BTC ? Do you fucking suppose that they will mine the BTC ? Have you ever heard of coindesk ? Exchanges ? Tumblers ? Are these being run as cooperatives ?

Starbucks processing more than 8 million transactions each week on its own wallet is just an alternate fact , ain't it ! \n\n> PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm\n\nAre there businesses which are NOT supposed to support the CEO and its shareholders to become a billionaire ?\n\nIf you feel that Paytm suffers from lack of basic communication , well , no one is forcing you to use it.\n\n> Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020\n\nRBI on blockchain-www.idrbt.ac.in/assets/publications/Best%20Practices/BCT.pdf\n\nRBI trying out blockchains - \nhttp://www.indiabitcoin.com/reserve-bank-of-india-successfully-tests-blockchain-technology/\n\nIndian banks trying out blockchains - \nhttp://www.coindesk.com/indias-bankchain-consortium-launches-blockchain-kyc-system/\n\nThe fricking behemoths that are SBI , ICICI and HDFC are already investing into the blockchain tech.\nRBI is all for it .

Not the technology behind the snake oil !\n\nOfftopic : The WannaCry ransomware was targeting people who still had XP or were using unpatched systems even after being warned by MS about the extra ordinary vulnerabilities. Now, the BTC is not something that is as easy as straightforward as opening a paypal or heck even an account in some despot-led tax haven country. \n\nI wonder if there were people ready to throw money at the hackers but could not understand the ABC of a BTC !\n\n\nAnother Offtopic : I read a book (or watched a documentary, can't remember) wherein some biologists and psychiatrists mentioned that the bubbles actually cause lunacy like symptoms. They did some fun studies to illustrate this and they took like brain scans as well. It was stupid enough that I dismissed it, but if anyone knows what I am talking about , please link me that book. call me old-school, I don't believe in bitcoins, investing in it is just nothing more than gambling. if few key players who owns the majority chunk of bitcoins will cash it out, it would never regain it's current market value, and that's just one possibility how it can go down, there are bazillion other possibilities that can cause the crash, meanwhile there is absolutely no assurance by any key economist, IMF, world bank that it's have any reliability and reason to stay. \n\nalso there is a big myth that it bitcoins can be transferred instantaneously, in reality conformation of transaction take hours.\n\nquite recently economist have published a very sensible article [\"*What if bitcoin bubble bursts?*\"](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21722841-latest-frenzy-tulip-mania-gold-rush-or-dotcom-boom-what-if-bitcoin-bubble), I suggest everyone to give it a read, and please do think thrice before 'investing' in bitcoins.

I don't think they will ever understand the tech behind blockchains in public sector.. Atleast not until the govt jobs are taken by merit and not by reservations.. It will be interesting to see the financial system in India collapse if this blockchain's catch up. We are in a dire need for this especially when our dear PM started a trend to ban fiats and every political party will join bandwagon.. Bitcoin is a interesting technology, far from mass adoption and with huge scaling problems. I would recommend you to invest in other gambling options, like blackjack or poker, in order to spread your speculation portfolio.",

    "body" : "Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. \n\nHere, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.\n\n**What are NPAs and why should we care?**\n\nLoans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. \n\nThe NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. \n\nOn top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. \n\n**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** \n\nSimply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, \"Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help.\" \n\n**What will the Government do about this?**\n\nOne word: Bailout. \nThis whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. \n\n**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**\n\nNo. \n\nHere's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:\n\n1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) \n\n2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)\n\n3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)\n\n5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)\n\nThe revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? \n\n(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)\n\n**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**\n\nThis problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! \n\n1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*\n\nThe banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.\n\nA Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). \n\n&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, \"People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”\n\nThey asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:\n\n&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.\"\n\nPersonally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? \n\n*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*\n\nIf anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.\n\n*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*\n\nIf this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. \n\nModi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.\n\n*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*\n\nAah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. \n\nThrough some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. \n\n*5) Big Corporates*\n\nThe usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...\n\nSome projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) \n\n**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**\n\nTo put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.\n\nIndian Express reported the NPA problem first on [February 9, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/).\n\nSensex posted the biggest weekly fall in 6 years on [February 12, 2016](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Sensex-posts-biggest-weekly-fall-in-over-6-years/articleshow/50963583.cms) and lost 1,631 points.\n\nEDIT 2: Gold!

    "comment" : " awesome writeup! thank you for taking the time to make the jargon clear to us! While bad on paper - the current scenario is actually better than expected.\n\nThe fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life - these loans extend to many many places, from large firms to small farmers.\n\nIt was always expected that some government, would have to intervene ecentually to fix this. It's the NDA who has to handle it, and I fully expect them to handle it. The issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers, with the GoI firmly in the driving seat.\n\nBut the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse. It's a mainstay of Indian politics, in one form or the other. One of the \"unspoken rules\" of the game so far.\n\nThe divestiture of PSUs, or stronger oversight/capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help. \n\nThe clean up of banks will be a good thing, and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector, which can handle any future negative shock.\n\nHonestly, this is business as expected. It's good that people are upset, but being upset won't make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking/private network.\n\nRules which are followed, divestment, distance between center/politics and PSU management are the cure - and they've been the cure since the reform process started, but haven't been completed.\n I can add few points on The Banks. My Dad is a Chief Manager of a Public Sector Bank in a Municipal Town based in TN.\n\nBranch Managers/Chief Managers don't like having NPAs on their books either. The problem stems from the Zonal Level. The Zonal Manager assigns quarterly/yearly loan targets to individual branches. Applications for larger (and possibly good) loans that are forwarded to the zonal managers sit on their desks for several weeks, the borrower usually moves on to a Private Bank. Now all that's left is smaller loan applications from shaky applicants, local politicians who wants to build schools/engineering colleges, and activists who would threaten to 'Write to the FM' (This happened a lot during the PC era).  The Zonal Management, despite being sloppy, still expects the Branch Managers to meet the targets. So BMs give the loan and hope it would not become a NPA before they get transferred, so that the live bomb is passed on to the new guy.\nWith a bit of negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management, you can avoid declaring few loans as NPA for a bunch of quarters. \n\nOh, and I don't even want to speak about the crazy ones that retire as Branch Managers. They go on a loaning spree. Thanks a lot. This is some major issue which no one seems to care about in media. I have been telling this to friends and family and actually no one really cares. \n\nWhat concerns me is the part where they might bail out these rich-ass people with public money. That will be unjust. These people have the means to pay back and yet they take advantage of out easy recovery norms.\n\nIrony is banks wouldn't write-off agricultural or small loans as these people are easier to bully and that will result in farmer suicides.\n\nBut they are happy to go with all the loss because somewhere we have lenient norms and these wigwigs are the ones who control our economic policies.\n\nEdit: **[The Hindu Editorial on this issue](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-bailout-with-taxpayer-money/article8241268.ece)**\n Loans being written off from the books or provisions being kept against bad debt doesn't mean that there won't be recovery. The whole Raghuram Rajan point in the opening post doesn't make sense. That would be like blaming a government which enforces accurate reporting of crimes for increase in crime statistics.\n\nThe lowly bank managers have little say in large loans. The decision for the biggest NPAs are taken at least at General Manager level (some even at Chairman level). One needs to investigate these bad loans, seize the assets of willful defaulters and charge the real decision-makers in bank.\n\nThe whole issue is that of bankers being browbeaten to give risky debt to industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing to pay up because they know that they have the connections and the power to avoid being hit by any action taken by common bank bankers (different ones from those who gave them loans). Great writeup. Thanks.    \nA question: Big corporates (say Vijay Mallya) take huge loans and then are not able to pay back and thus the write off. What does the law do here? Can't it catch the culprits and send them to jail? Or probably auction the properties that were kept as a guarantee while taking loan? I haven't heard of a bigshot (except Sahara) who is sent to Jail for not paying back the money.  Vijay Mallaya is a free man and they fucked up my credit score because i missed one payment on my education loans.\n\n yenna rascals i tell ya.  > On top of it, Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits and got a payout of $515 million.\n\nRs515cr not $million. Pedantic but couldn't resist because of my intermittent OCD. sorry. \n\n>How can they ask the banks to waive off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of how the big defaulters are?\n\nThe Banks know who are the borrowers and RBI does not, so this is not an issue. \n\nSecondly, the loans are not being waived (as in cancelled or forgiven/forgotten). That's a wrong and dangerous word to use in this context. \n\nThe loans are being written off. What that means is, as you say earlier in you post, that once the borrower has failed to service the loan (willingly or due to the things he can't control) the banks write-off (called provisioning; could be partial or full) that in their P&L and Balance Sheet to show the true reflection of their own health (Rajan is pushing for aggressive approach, as you mention later in the post). That does not mean that the borrower walks away. The Banks continue to make efforts to recover the money (through notices, public-shaming, selling assets of borrower, change of management, restructuring, conversion into equity, court-cases, sale of loan to ARCs etc). If a loan (or part of that) has been written off by the bank, and the bank manages to recover it, the amount is written back and becomes a profit for that year. \n\nAn interesting example here would be the business cycle of mid 90s-early 2000s. At that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually in a worse shape than today. But fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most of the bank clients turned around and Banks averted a disaster. Most borrowers were commodity companies at that time (steel, cement etc). \n\nThis time this is not likely to happen. So the mess wouldn't clear itself up. \n\n> They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money,\n\nNot only did they not take these measures they actually forced the Banks to lend to their *favored* borrowers. one of the biggest defaulter is Unitech, which people say is a Gandhi-family company (rumor; don't ask for source). JP group another big defaulter was close to BSP, Jindals to Congress, HCC to Pawar, DLF to Huda/Vadra and so on. \n\n> They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts.\n\nIf the government/banks play by the book (which is a big ask) they need not. Seize their fucking assets. If they have given a personal guarantee, seize their homes too. \n\n> So what happens next?\n\nShort term- Government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive\n\nMedium term- Hopefully this Government puts professional management into the top layers of the bank (Board and CMD) and the rot is contained. It is happening in Bank Of Baroda but again a tall ask\n\nLong term- The relative size of the PSU bank will shrink, pvt banks will become bigger. \n\nOne last point. Why are politicians reluctant in reforming or privatizing the Banks? Because that is the biggest tool of granting favors to corporates who in turn are the biggest political donors. \n\nThe last last point. There is a Silver lining, The bank's problem is a stock-problem i.e. the loans already given are going bad and we need to deal with it. What the system does not have, fortunately, is the 'flow' problem ie new money is coming into the system and if the investment cycle picks up, we will have the money to fund it.  Relevant Documentary: **[Overdose: The Next Financial Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECi6WJpbzE)** It is really appreciated that we have people like you who are willing to be frank about such situations. >Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and **the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore.** Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore.\n\nThe reason why this happened is because Mallaya used the trademarks and labels of kingfisher as collateral with the banks. But the value of these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt. Now this goes without saying that a brand name would lose its value if it goes bankrupt, so why did banks took the risk of taking kingfisher trademarks as collateral in the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation.\n\n\n>The bench headed by Chief Justice asked,\n\n>It is all there in this Indian Express report.\n\nWell, that's strange!\n\nIs supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from a newspaper's report?\n",

    "body" : "Hello /r/India!\n\nI bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. \n\nBoy do I have stories for you today!\n\nLast week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.\n\nLet’s get right into it!\n\n___\n#Money Bill strikes again!\n___\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!\n\n\nThe first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.\n\nAnd this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!\n\nThe Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).\n\n___\n#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players\n___\n\nThe FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). \n\nThe logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.\n\nThis amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.\n\n___\n#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016\n___\nDuring the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. \n\nThe decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.\n\n**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**\n\nWhile giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. \n\nStill no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.\n\n[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)\n\nThe Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.\n\n[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)\n\nAfter the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.\n\n[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)\n\nNot a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. \n\nThe Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).\n\n___\n#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped\n___\nLeader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). \nTo give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.\n\nBut then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.\n\nJaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating. \n\n___\n#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter\n___\nRajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. \n\n> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)\n\nHamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. \n\nHere’s an excerpt from the debate:\n\n[\"Please stop making inane noise\"](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)\n\n[\"Please stop talking... or else\"](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)\n\n[\"RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!\"](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)\n\nAfter the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.\n\n[Obama... I mean... Ansari out!](http://giphy.com/gifs/obama-mic-drop-out-3o7qDLkrKr034Z3hQI)\n\n___\n#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures\n___\nThere have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. \n\nThe pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.\n\nLast week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. \n\nOn 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.\n\n**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**\n\n‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.\n\nThe Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.\n\n\n___\n#Legislative Business Last week\n___\n\n**Lok Sabha**\n\n- Demand for Grants: Ministry of Social Justice and Welfare\n\n- Demand for Grants: Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism\n\n- Demand for Grants: Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation\n\n- Outstanding Demand for Grants\n\n- Appropriation (no. 2) Bill, 2016 \n\n- [Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, 2015](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-compensatory-afforestations-fund-bill-2015-3782/)\n\n- Finance Bill, 2016\n\n- [Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-bill-2015-4100/) \n\n- Discussion on Water Crisis and Drought situation in the country (Underway)\n\n**Rajya Sabha**\n\n- [Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2015](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-mines-and-minerals-development-and-regulation-amendment-bill-2015-3648/)\n\n- Railways Appropriation Bill, 2016\n\n- [Anti-Hijacking Bill, 2014](http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-anti-hijacking-amendment-bill-2014-3500/)\n\n- Discussion on Functioning of Ministry of Human Resource Development\n\n- Discussion on Functioning of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\n\n- Calling Attention of the Defence Minister on Agusta Westland deal\n\n___\n\nThank you for the shoutout in the last post /u/dextermilburn!\n___\n\n[Fin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxkUEtZ_MtY)\n\n___\n\n[Last Week's post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4h3ioz/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_april_25_april/)\n\n\nEDIT: Tiny grammar edits and added last week's post.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you for the gold (x2) kind strangers!

    "comment" : " This is brilliant. Has there been any media coverage at all about FDI in politics? This could change the way crony capitalism in this country works.  >BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players\n\n>Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha.\n\nProof if any needed, that BJP & Congress are no different from each other! They'll join hands and throw out democracy if it benefited them.\n\n>The ‘Jumla’ that escaped\n\nNot just a 'jumla' but the likes of 'scam' that this very BJP govt chased Congress out of power!\n\nIn 2005, then CM Modi abruptly announced that the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) had discovered 20 trillion cubic feet of gas in KG basin (that the BJP promptly renamed the Deendayal West area block), which would generate revenue worth Rs. 2.2 lakh crore for India! Everyone (including the state and central administrations as well as subject experts) was astonished at this fantastic claim. \n\nIf true, such a find would have made India energy self-sufficient, a must for any country aspiring for super power status. Modi’s announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind of the 2002 riots to a potential Prime Ministerial candidate. \n\nIn fact, given how events unfolded, it is abundantly clear that the announcement (like everything else PM Modi does) was just another exaggerated publicity stunt.\n\n Modiji pays heed exclusively to his own mann ki baat! He thus ignored the field report, and forced GSPC to go ahead with the project. Because of this, GSPC borrowed nearly Rs 20,000 crore from 15 different public and private sector banks. And what does India have in return? Nothing! \n\nBut the issue is not just about Modiji’s gaseous exaggerations. It is also about diversion of public funds and corruption. After coercing GSPC to go ahead with drilling in KG basin, CM Modi forced it to partner with a company named Geo Global. Now here’s the interesting bit:\n\n*Geo Global  was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with GSPC. At the time of entering into the agreement with GSPC, Geo Global’s capital was reportedly a measly Rs 3,200. A week after the agreement, its capital mushroomed to Rs 10,000 crore.*\n\n>In its report for the year ended March 31, 2015, tabled in state assembly this year, CAG had pulled up GSPC for its lack of experience as 'overseas operator'. \"The delay in execution of the work committed resulted in cost escalations in overseas blocks. As a result, the company had incurred expenditure of Rs 1,757.46 crore for 10 surrendered blocks, of which Rs 1,734.12 crore has been written off,\" the apex auditor noted.\n\nWas this public money diverted to fund Modi ji’s extravagant 2014 election campaign? Does this not merit an independent high level judicial probe? And even more interestingly, when the screws were tightened on Vijay Mallya for defaulting on Rs. 9000 crore, why is GSPC not being subject to similar treatment? Why is it that instead, its Managing Director was rewarded with an appointment as the [Director of the National Informatics Centre?](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-18/news/63568239_1_gujarat-state-petroleum-corporation-deity-gspc)\n\nHowever, desperately the BJP may sycophantically defend PM Modi, the bitter reality is that under him corruption was rampant in Gujarat. Consider how [he gave 250 acres of land (in a restricted wildlife zone) to cronies of the current CM of Gujarat for less than Rs. 1.5 crore.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/anandiben-patels-daughter-in-soup-over-gir-sanctuary-land-deal-congress-wants-sit-probe/1/588670.html)\n\nSimilarly, [CM Modi gave public land for the Mundra SEZ.](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/the-great-land-grab/article4666181.ece), which was worth Rs. 1500 per square metre for a pittance (anything between Rs. 01 & Rs. 32) That is why for years, the CAG was deliberately denied access to numerous files in Gujarat. And that is also why under Modi ji, a Lokayukta was not appointed for 10 years.\n\nIn his avatar as Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi ji had famously argued “main na khata hoon, na khaane deta hoon”. It seems the truth is different.\n\nReports:\n\n[CAG-GSPC-2016](http://www.cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Gujarat_%20Public_Sector_Undertakings_Report_1_2016.pdf)\n\n[CAG-GSPC-2015](http://www.cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Gujarat_Report_2_2015.pdf)\n\n[CAG-GSPC-2011](http://www.cag.gov.in/sites/default/files/audit_report_files/Gujarat_Commercial_2011.pdf)\n >>They spent Rs 19,700 over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture.\n\n\n19,700 crore you mean right? \n\nAlso, nice work! :) Hey, this is very interesting. Please keep it up, thank you! Firstly, great job man. This is the real shit. I'm so angry about FDI in politics, and other issues I wouldn't really have cared to watch Rajya Sabha TV/Lok Sabha TV for.\n\nI wanted to ask- what is the law regarding corporations donating to campaigns of political parties in India? Are corporations considered as people and granted the same rights of free speech? (free speech = throw money where you want, that's the logic in US Supreme Courts' Citizen United anyways) thank you sir, for your valuable service.\n\nI really look forward to next week.\n\nI am whatsapp-ing this link to couple of groups. This makes my blood boil, what can citizens do to curb this ? >During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, **Asaduddin Owaisi** raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment.\n\n\nwow, so everyone remains quiet and only he had the guts to question to this? Dude, thanks a lot for what you do. Te fact that someone is actually summarizing what's going on in the Indian parliament actually helps us know what's going on. You should get like a page in a major paper where anyone can read this. Thanks a lot! Very informative. [Applause](https://localtvwtkr.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/michelleclap.gif?w=770)",

In software,  money in in software engineering, not IT. But there is a fair demand for IT programmers. It is same as more IT jobs,  more diploma holders, less pay. Less Software Engineering jobs, more the pay. But I guess, I don't want to recommend you doing 4 years bachelors yet again. MAKE BEST OUT OF YOUR 4 YEARS BACHELORS.

Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.\n\n\nIn such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...\n\nWish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. \n\nYou just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.\n\nAnd it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. \n\nBut, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.\n\nPS: Enjoy the Hindutva way of running an economy, India. Just another 5 years. Or maybe 50. Make the most of it anyway. Condition of bhakturds in 4 months of Modi 2.0 \nhttps://twitter.com/free_thinker/status/1168042369909805057 Man, I miss good old of Days of Manmohan Singh.. Remember we used to have an economy ? Now what we have is just shit and giggles",

    "comment" : " One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.\nLong story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.\n\nAlso privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.\n\nThis is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 \n2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China \n3) Indian economy rested on what we call \"black money\" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. \n\nProbable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. \n\nPossible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!\n\nWe were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! In a free economy, people have choice to use either cash or electronic/ banking medium. Cash has its own positives and cons. Once printed, it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost. However, the electronic transactions charge per transaction. Both the system should compete, and people can choose. Cash shouldn’t be a dirty word. It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.\n\nTill 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. \n\nIn between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \\~Rs.21,000 Cr. \n\nThe government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.\n\nRich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. \n\nNow coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. \n\nI think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. \n\nWe need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   \nThere are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\\[1\\] [economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65845118.cms?from=mdr&utm\\_source=contentofinterest&utm\\_medium=text&utm\\_campaign=cppst](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/65845118.cms?from=mdr&utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)",

There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.\n\nWhen there is a good crop, the prices are down. \nThey sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.\n\nComing to Auto sector, \"Maruti\" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. \n\nThis government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.\nGiving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.\n\nIrony.\n\nSituation will only get worse. Don't worry. > The liquidity crunch has become tighter because it’s no longer as easy to do business. AIM Nonwovens sought refunds of Rs21 lakh for the Goods & Services Tax...\n\nThis bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.\nIn a nutshell what i mean is think of the impact of Hollywood on usa's economy in terms of tourism and attracting people from all over the world not to mention their sheer dominance on the global stage",

Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. \n\nA virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. \n\nThe implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.\n\nThe importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. \n\n\nThey survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. \n\nHaving very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.\n\nThe survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",

See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you!

Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China?",

    "comment" : " An undivided India would've been a disaster which would have made Indians pine for the rule of the British. The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.\n\nThere would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. \n\nIn foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. \n\nIndia would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. \n\nIn terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.\n\nThe situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.\n\nPeople often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.\n\nTL:DR is thank you Jinnah. India is not united right now?",

    "body" : "**Who appointed Urjit Patel?**\n\nNarendra Modi.\n\n**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**\n\nBecause Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.\n\n\n**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**\n\nBecause Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA's.\n\n\n**Why does the Government want all this money?**\n\nBecause banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.\n\n\n**Why companies are declaring NPA's?**\n\nBecause their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.\n\n\n**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**\n\nIf that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.\n\n\n**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**\n\nBecause many companies were declaring NPA's and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.\n\n\n**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**\n\nBecause that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.\n\n\n**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**\n\nPrices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.\n\n\n\n**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**\n\nIt is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.\n\n\n\n**Why GST Collection has fallen?**\n\nBecause it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.\n\n\n\n**Why Business Volume has fallen?**\n\nIf you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can't expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.\n\n\n\n**What is the immediate danger?**\n\nTelecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.\n\n\n**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**\n\nFormer CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.\n\n\n\n**Who is responsible for all this mess?**\nOf course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.\n\n**Who should resign?**\n\nThat's a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.\n\n\n**Who should you vote for in 2019?**\n\nOf course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes 'care' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 > 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.\n\nBecause there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in 'Entire Political Science' and a missing BA.\n\nNow how dare you think of voting for anyone else?\"\n",

As an active trader, I really hate Congress.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** \n\n ______ \nIndia retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in\nthe January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's\n\nGDP or gross domestic product\n\ngrowth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of\ngrowth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),\nmanufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)\ncontributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,\nreported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll\nfor annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in\nOctober-December quarter.\n\nFor the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1\nper cent recorded in the previous year.\n\nTushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: \"Today's GDP number is very\ncomforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have\nmoved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up\nin investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.\"  \n  \nThe faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen\nexpectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. \"We expect RBI to\nrevise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in\nAugust policy,\" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara\nCapital.  \n\nMany economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in\n2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.\n\nThough global rating agency\n\nMoody's earlier this week\n\ncut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter\nfinancial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per\ncent this fiscal year.\n\nGDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,\npotentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.\n\nEconomists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward\npressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil\nprices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India\nmeets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.\n\nDomestic\n\nprices of petrol and diesel\n\nare near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down\ntaxes on the fuels.\n\nRising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The\ngovernment's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per\nbarrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.\n\nHigher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a\nrecord low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against\nthe US dollar.\n\n__ Comments\n\nBanking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak\nfollowing a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new\nloans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted\nfor the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector\nin 2017.\n\nSeparately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as\nagainst 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1’s triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.\n\n> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India’s celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.\n\n> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA’s 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...\n\n> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...\n\n> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.\n\n> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It’s ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world’s most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. \n\n> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. \n\n> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA’s tenure.\n\n> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

    "comment" : " Here you go - \n\n\nHere is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:\n\n1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.\n\n2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.\n\n3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.\n\n4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.\n\n5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.\n\n6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.\n\n7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.\n\n8. For destroying the pillars of Democracy by de-fanging media and institutions - which are critical to offer any semblance of truth and justice.\n\n9. For not listening to people and the diversity of voices - but to impose dictates via coercion and intimidation.\n\n10. For being anti-intellectual and actively promoting the hatred of the learned and the educated.\n\n11. For doing all the tricks in the book to curb dissent and freedom of expression.\n\n12. For sinking all the human development indexes since 2014.\n\n13. For waging a fake 'morality play 'of anti-corruption crusade when the real policies of the government point to the opposite direction.\n\n14. For hiding from unscripted questions which the people want to ask you - no single press conference since you came to power.\n\n15. For focussing on PR, publicity, events and propaganda, but not the real issues of the nation.\n\n16. For ruining India's traditional 'non-aligned' foreign policy.\n\n17. For instigating the ego - hate and greed - through your theatrical 'carrot and stick' speeches.\n\n18. For surrounding yourself with sycophants who have no talent for governance.\n\n19. For being obsessive about grandiose ideas/ misplaced priorities and failing to deliver.\n\n20. For misunderstanding the meaning of 'development' by neglecting social justice.\n\n21. For being pro-super-rich and putting the poor and the Middle class under the technocratic Neoliberal Economic policies which have hollowed out the West.\n\n22. For raging a war against India via the toxic brew of Hindutva and Neoliberalism, and destroying the people's faith and trust upon the government.\n\nAnd you ask, what I have done to deserve this? Hahahahaha. Like always, Mudiji ne toh rhetoric question pucha tha. Launda serious ho gaya.  I still remember the height of his popularity in 2014, the man has come crashing down hard. With so much popularity and full numbers in the house, he would have easily assured another term if he had only surrounded himself who wasn't an ass-licker !! RIP Devdan Chaudhari. Either dead or arrested. 😰 Reading his 22 points made me realize that there are only more to add, nothing to reduce. Very well said. I hope modi reads it.

But by the promises I make in this interview. \"Don't judge me on the basis of my two biggest policy failures,\" says elected politician. Either he is a moron or he thinks his audience are morons. Oh... we forgot to congratulate the PM on his *second* ever interview in 3 years!! Round of applause people. He was finally able to make it out of his mansion to give another interview with no difficult questions! It must have been quite the task to get all the questions correct.  Did he just admit that Demonetisation was a failure? Should we then judge him on:\n\n- Imposing an Adhaar which was meant only for public distribution service on everyone in an orwellian way.\n\n- Having the worst record for job creation. \n\n- Residing over the worst private investment record since 1950's.\n\nEdit: - A Rafale deal which was steeped in crony capitalism.\n\n- Increasing income inequality.\n\n- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.\n\n- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.\n\n- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. \n\n- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.\n\n- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit\n\n- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.\n\n- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India\n\n- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans\n\n- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.\n\n- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive\n\n- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.\n\n- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.\n\n- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation\n\n- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.\n\n- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.\n\n- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.\n\n- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.\n\n- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.\n\n- Trying to destroy the environment in order to build infrastructure including vast tracts of forest. Ok... let's talk cow vigilantism? Or moral policing? Or hate speeches? Or rising intolerance? Or the failure of clean Ganga? Or swachh Bharat? Or let's talk about Adityanath becoming a dictator? Or the lack of a policy on Pakistan? Or China making inroads in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal?  Evaluate me on inciter, instigator, provocateur, rabble-rouser, demagoguery skills, rather. We all can judge him on throwing skills (feku). Mitron!!! Evaluate me on the unemployment crisis, the lack of private investment in the county, rising malnutrition, making AYUSH equal to allopathy (MCI Bill), supporting Aadhar after I opposed it, having biryani with China after I ridiculed my predecessor for it, the rising inflation, destroying institutions like the RTI, CEC and CVC, not appointing Lokpal after almost 4 years and renaming schemes.  Kyun behen ke loude... GST and demonitisation is what affected every common man across the country.

    "body" : "An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.\n\n---\n\n**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes\n\n1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:\n * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\n\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:\n * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).\n * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.\n * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions\n\n3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.\n\n4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period \"post-liberalisation\" for each economy:\n * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\nKorea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|\nBGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|\nThailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|\nIndonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|\nMalaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|\nChina|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|\nVietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|\nIndia|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|\n\n5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:\n * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.\n * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.\n\n * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)\n\n * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.\n\n**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",

There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. \n\nSecondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. \n\nThe problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.\n\nIf anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. \n\nI'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**First part**\n\n> Slow but Steady: Western Economies\n\n> Accelerated Growth: East Asia\n\nThis is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. \n\nMost people mistakenly think this is the \"East Asian\" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. \n\nSome people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.\n\nAs far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called \"auxiliary services\". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.\n\nAs for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.\n\nOur largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. \n\nIn footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN.",

    "comment" : " Is BARF really the abbreviation for it? Lmao ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** \n\n ______ \nThe Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big\nBelt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much\nwailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is\npractically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that\ndozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of\ntheir governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government\ndeliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as\nstubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.\n\nWell, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign\npolicy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on\ngrounds that are both principled and realist.\n\nThe government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-\narticulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that\n\"connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility\nto avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;\nbalanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;\ntransparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to\nhelp long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local\ncommunities.\" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the\npath of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-\ninitiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were\nclearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the\nsustainability issues involved.\n\nWhile India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it\nis not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The\nGuardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the\nresolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental\nreasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of\n\"isolation\" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign\nup to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India\nis the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the\nsubject, and of that we can be proud.\n\nLet's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take\nadvantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free\ncountry and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian\nmanufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by\nChina, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.\nIt is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what\nOBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own\nposition in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will\nnot, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in\nparticular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on\ninfrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS\nBank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.\nThis is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently\nviolate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would\nfail to uphold.\n\nThis is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has\ntaken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In\nalmost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of\nManmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in\nsuch matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the\nSingh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's\nsensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:\nBeijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's \"core\ninterests\". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to\nthe Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-\nII, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact\nwith Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would\nalso have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit\nfrom the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's\nsensitivities.\n\nBy taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi\nhas done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand\non a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.\n\nThere are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is\nessentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and\neconomics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a\nleader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an\nalternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-\ndriven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's\nAmerica turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free\nmovement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles\neverywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.\n\nAnd second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this\nregard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which\nserve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries\nand economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,\nSingapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.\n\nModi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning\nto deliver. He must keep going.\n\n_(Mihir Swarup Sharma is a fellow at the Observer Research\nFoundation.)_**Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the\npersonal opinions of the author.

    "comment" : " Modi stopped blaming someone? The fuck are you smoking bro?  What do you expect him to do? Take ownership of his mistakes??\n\nLet's be reasonable here.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**It’s time Modi government stopped blaming RBI** \n\n ______ \nOverall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI\n\nBefore the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council—a body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles—publicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India’s policy interest rate at six percent.\n\nThis could have been, and was, predicted. India’s central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.\n\nFormal requirements apart, of course, it would’ve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government’s pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank’s priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages—and, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.\n\nThis illustrates the government’s great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months—its attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets—haven’t been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI’s worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.\n\nOverall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it’s clear that the RBI won’t bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment—which, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first—will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nFrankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn’t touched since its first few months in power: to India’s problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.\n\nRecently, India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there’s no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren’t propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That’s hardly sustainable.\n\nNor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it’s running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states’ mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India’s private sector.\n\nIt’s hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it’s not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it’s not a triumph either. It’s time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they’ve left pending—and stopped blaming the RBI.

Their bhakti knows no bounds. /s this can not b digested by modi bashers A cashless economy is the ONLY way to win the war on black money.  Demonitization attacks stores of existing cash and forces people to learn new methods of payments.  But in the long term, it is only when the government can track each and every transaction that a person makes at the click of a button that the capacity to generate future black money will be drastically reduced.  (and yes, I'm ignoring other benefits of cashless economy such as lack of printing/storage/productivity wasted by getting and storing cash, etc)\n\nOf course he is going to say cashless economy is a boon - Any economist who says going cashless for is bad is a fucking moron. Cashless economy is a boon however shoving it down people's throat by a democratic government isn't. The large majority of those bearing the brunt of demonetization policies are precisely the ones that aren't paying their legal share of taxes regardless of the infrastructure and systems that do facilitate their livelihoods. We live in a country where tax administration only reaches a small fraction of the population.\n\nI'm not accusing them, I'm merely stating a fact. Having lived income-tax-free for decades means they've paid less than their expected share toward national interest. Subsequently having to change money and lose a sum in the transaction one day, or having to suffer the inconvenience of setting up a bank account isn't an unreasonable consequence. \n\nMany of them are poor but taxes are in some sense an investment for our peoples' future; having a functional society or lift hundreds of millions from poverty will require a budget. Generally speaking, we can have a drawn-out process of social and technological modernization and prolong poverty, or we can do more in shorter order with more resources. This is not something to be contested, this is all obvious, yet people will waste time arguing even the most basic logic.\n\nWe should be as creative as we can in our solutions to mitigate the costs of modernization. But there are few low-hanging fruit that will effect meaningful reform on national scale. It is true, one such demonetization even will not break the effect of black money on India; but as one piece of commitment to a multi-pronged, long-term strategy, we can make it work.\n\nThe key has to be that someone does something. Government in India often does not meet even this most basic requirement with respect to facilitating our social or technological development. We can argue day and night about everything, always starting from square one, always starting from the most basic philosophical assumptions, but we're guaranteed nothing will change if nothing is attempted.\nPerhaps Modi has not done everything he could or should, maybe we can question his motives all day and night, but he has begun doing something, taking some calculated, novel risk, to produce national momentum. He has justified his own salary in some small way.\n Nobel laureate says demonetisation kills black money and has increased liquidity of the banks\n\n---\n\n> * Demonetisation has brought the rural and unorganised sectors into the banking fold, says Muhammad Yunus\n\n> * Cashless economy is a boon, Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank and Nobel Peace Prize winner, has said.\n\n> * Professor Yunus was awarded the Nobel Prize for successfully taking micro-credit and micro-finance to the doorsteps of poor rural women in Bangladesh.\n\n> * The Grameen Bank that was founded in 1976 to take banking to the doorsteps of rural women, had a customer base of over 90 lakh today, he said.\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n> * [Demonetisation: Two Nobel laureates come out in support, say cashless is boon](http://www.firstpost.com/business/demonetisation-two-nobel-laureates-come-out-in-support-say-cashless-is-boon-3190706.html)\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme Nobel peace prize.

It doesn't seem like he is well informed on the subject and the trauma this action has caused.\n\nHe wants expanded access to banking and thinks \"rural and unorganised sectors sectors\" have come into banking, which is not true--most of India is just waiting for cash liquidity to return.\n\nSo as usual, the general goals--reducing black money, or the later rationale of expanding access to banking, etc.--are all fine, but the program announced on Nov 8 has been an unequivocal disaster.",

In its latest report, the World Bank has said, \"The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.\"\n\nAccording to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.\n\nINDIA PICKING UP\n\nThe World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending.\n\nWriting in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, \"In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.\"\n\nAccording to the World Bank, \"India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.\"\n\nCHINA SLIPS\n\nIn terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate.\n\nThe World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.\n\nThe World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of \"elevated domestic debt.\"\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.\n\nSimilarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China's growth prospects.\n\nAlso read:\n\nChina flexing muscle?

Negative feedback loop.  > Fitch Ratings has lowered India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth “unexpectedly faltered” in the April-June quarter.\n\nThat's quite a decline just after a quarter, but I expect that this is going to decline more after September quarter economy report comes out.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Fitch lowers growth forecast for Indian economy to 6.9% this fiscal** \n\n ______ \nFitch also warned that large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment. File photo: Bloomberg\n\nNew Delhi: Fitch Ratings has lowered India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth “unexpectedly faltered” in the April-June quarter.\n\nThe credit rating agency said however that it expects the economic activity to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year with the waning impact of one-off events including the demonetisation shock in late 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July, which had dampened growth in the short term.\n\n“The large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could, however, dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment,” Fitch Ratings in its latest global economic outlook (GEO). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had last month slashed India’s GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7% from 7.4% owing to weakness in private consumption, manufacturing output and business investment.\n\nIndia had posted a 7.1% growth in 2016-17. ADB pencilled in 7.4% for 2018-19, down from the earlier forecast of 7.6% in July. Fitch Ratings said the global economy has improved markedly this year and is on course to recording its fastest expansion since 2010.\n\nIndia’s GDP growth at 5.7% in the first quarter (April-June), down from 6.1% in the previous year, is “the lowest outturn since early 2013, and GDP has now been cooling for five consecutive quarters”, it said. Economic activity in the quarter, it said, may have been disrupted by firms running down inventory ahead of the implementation of the GST in July.\n\nThe manufacturing sector lost steam in the quarter, growing at a meagre 1.2% year-on-year. The primary sector also dampened growth, while construction and tertiary activity bounced back. On the expenditure side, net trade was a big drag on growth, with exports decelerating sharply (after an admittedly strong January-March print) and import growth remaining buoyant (at 13.4% year-on-year).\n\n“In light of the poor 1H17 (first half of 2017) outturns, we have downgraded our forecast for FY17-18 (year-ending March 2018) to 6.9 per cent, a cut of 0.5 percentage points compared to the June GEO,” Fitch said.\n\nForecasting acceleration in activity in the second half of the current fiscal, it said consumption should drive the pick-up in growth. “Motorcycle sales — a good indicator of rural household consumption — have gained strong momentum, bouncing back in July and August after having fallen sharply in 1H17. Investment is also expected to tick up in the quarters ahead, in part bolstered by ramped-up public sector infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate to 6% in August, resuming the monetary easing cycle initiated in early 2015. “However, monetary policy loosening has taken place in the context of rapidly falling inflation, implying that the RBI’s policy stance as measured by the real policy rate has not been so accommodative,” it added.\n\nThe global economy has improved markedly this year but the current favourable mix of strong growth and highly accommodative macro policies could be as good as it gets, it said. “Our forecasts imply something of a ‘sweet spot’ for the global economy in 2017 and 2018 with above-trend growth and still highly accommodative global monetary policies. However, this is not a pattern we expect to persist into 2019 and beyond as output gaps close in advanced economies and monetary policy support is withdrawn,” said Brian Coulton, Fitch’s chief economist.\n\nGlobal growth has been upgraded to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in June, and 2018 growth has been upgraded to 3.2% from 3.1%.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

More devious than any Bollywood baddie, it is everywhere but nowhere. Real but incorporeal, it is difficult to destroy because it leaves no trace or paper trail.\n> \n> Until last month. On Nov 8, corruption came under the crosshairs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with his decision to cull the two highest-denomination banknotes, the 500-rupee and the 1,000-rupee notes (roughly S$10 and S$20) from circulation. By value they made up around 85 per cent of Indian currency.\n> \n> When the move was announced in a 40-minute televised address to the nation, most of the world was watching another democracy poised at a decisive point - the election between Mr Donald Trump and Mrs Hillary Clinton.\n> \n> Mr Modi presented his policy as a chance for every citizen to fight corruption. The underlying logic was that these were the notes used most often by the corrupt, who evade taxes and fuel an underground economy. Known in India as black money, this parallel economy is estimated by the World Bank to be at least one-fifth the size of India's gross domestic product. Notes in these denominations were also found to be counterfeited by terrorists and used to pay for bombs and bombers.\n> \n> At midnight of Nov 8, 85 per cent of the country's cash, worth nearly S$300 billion, became just a pile of paper. If stacked up, it would be 300 times the height of Mt Everest. If laid out, five times the distance to the moon and back.\n> \n> For an economy where most transactions - 98 per cent by volume and 75 per cent by value - are in cash, the shock can't possibly be overstated.\n> \n> Yet, there is a strange and surprising calm in its wake. Queues at banks to exchange the worthless money for new or smaller notes have been serpentine but, remarkably for India, largely orderly thus far. Because not enough new notes were printed and because the ATMs needed to be retooled to dispense them, a limit was set on how much could be withdrawn at a time. Yet, social media posts displayed mostly forbearance and snarky humour. It's more than a little puzzling how inconvenience could be lightly worn in a matter as personal as the government rationing access to money in your own bank account.\n> \n> India's opposition parties said in Parliament last Friday that 100 deaths had been linked to demonetisation and demanded the government apologise and roll back the move. But this is by no means a popular demand. It's almost as though a nation, its great promise betrayed time and again by poor leadership, has stretched a cautious hand to Mr Modi.\n> \n> Opinion in the media has been less forgiving. One month into demonetisation, economists say the move will hit India's growth rate, with evidence mounting of shrinking manufacturing and consumer spending. Fears are that crop harvests will be hit too, because farmers are in bank queues when they should be in the fields for the winter sowing season.\n> \n> Mr Lawrence Summers, the former US treasury secretary, writing in the Financial Times, described the move as \"the most sweeping change in currency policy that has occurred anywhere in the world in decades\". Although Mr Summers advocates abolishing the US$100 note and has welcomed the phasing out this year of the €500 note - the so-called Bin Laden note because of its use by terror financiers, drug dealers and money launderers - he saw the Indian attempt as disruptive and triggering no real change.\n> \n> The Economist thought Mr Modi had done a botched job out of a misplaced faith in his technocratic skills. Mr Kaushik Basu, a former World Bank chief economist, writing in The New York Times, called it a major mistake, albeit a well-intentioned one. Popular Times of India columnist Shobhaa De wrote that Mr Modi was living in a bubble, \"an isolated, lonely man\" committing \"political harakiri\".\n> \n> As I see it, Mr Modi has struck a chord with the honest, hard-working folk who have long watched politicians not only turn a blind eye to corruption but also enable it.\n> \n> In its sheer ambition, Mr Modi's move compares to American president Franklin D. Roosevelt's dismantling of the gold standard, with which he pulled the US out of the Great Depression. Roosevelt jolted the Americans in April 1933 when he gave them about a month in which to exchange gold - coins, bullion, certificates - at the Federal Reserve for US$20.67 an ounce. Two months later, the government delinked the dollar from its gold reserves, discarding the monetary norm of half a century which was preventing it from aggressively pumping in money needed to revive the tailspinning economy.\n> \n> Post-independence, India has seen only one other action of this magnitude to alter the trajectory of the nation - prime minister P V Narasimha Rao's economic liberalisation in the 1990s, which reversed decades of socialist policies and steered an almost bankrupt India to globalisation.\n> \n> Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others among the first generation of post-colonial Indian leaders were influenced by Western thought and recognised the need for modernisation. While Gandhi, the father of the nation, forswore any role in policy or government after independence, Nehru delighted in Western ideals. He enthusiastically brought home the progressive mores of the time, turning India into a planned, protected economy, with decidedly mixed results. In contrast, the second generation of Asia's leaders, such as Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, saw the merits of the West but also its pitfalls and drew upon their own cultures, with startling economic success.\n> \n> Mr Modi's attempt to combat corruption, if rewarded with even a measure of success, could unleash India's potential by consolidating all economic activity. Consider that astonishingly few Indians, just 1 per cent, pay income tax. The country ranks 76th out of 168 in Transparency International's corruption perception index - a shameful place for a democracy and emerging economy to occupy.\n> \n> However, Mr Modi's crusade can be undermined by the toxic political baggage he carries. Nurtured by a Hindu militant organisation and espousing nationalist ideas, Mr Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat during the 2002 communal riots, in which more than a thousand people, mostly Muslims, lost their lives.\n> \n> On the other hand, technology is his greatest friend. His demonetisation move has swiftly morphed into a push for digitisation which will make the economy more efficient and transparent at one stroke.\n> \n> In a country of 1.2 billion, a cashless economy is a distant goal. There are fewer than 1.5 million machines that can handle card transactions in stores. Some 1,800 people share one machine in India, compared to 60 in China and 25 in the US. More Indians than Americans are online these days, just behind the number of users in China, but that looks more impressive than it is. Only 13 out of 100 rural Indians have Internet access. One of two - 600 million people - still do not have bank accounts. And half of them have no government ID required to open a bank account.\n> \n> If it continues to go forward, the push against corruption has the potential to eventually bolster India's place as an engine for world growth even as China falters. It may even offer a lesson to China, which is beset by the very same affliction of corruption. In fact, China's Global Times approvingly noted the move. \"Modi's move is very bold. We cannot imagine what would happen in China if the country bans its 50- and 100-yuan notes,\" the daily said in a Nov 26 opinion piece. \"By observing India's reforms we will draw lessons, which would in turn help us understand our own reforms.\" where the fuck is /u/anti_anti_adblock when you need him?

The trouble later was equally so. The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so.\n\nDelhi’s denials of reality would be funny if it weren’t for the tragic consequences. On the economy, this denial dates back to 2012 when Manmohan Singh was in charge and Rahul Gandhi has only now underlined that unemployment was the problem. Yashwant Sinha has edited a book on The Future of the Indian Economy and documented the continuing crisis.\n\nEmployment is only a part of the story. Arvind Panagariya was more direct. The corporate sector has performed well, he said. Investment output and employment have been rising. He took averages to make comparisons, which is not good statistics for analysis of short-run changes, for if there are three numbers 5, 10 and 15, the average is 5 but there is wild oscillation. Panagariya has written a good book on the Indian economy but he is not a great statistician. His use of averages to force the argument that the blip last year and this year will be reversed is flawed. Fortunately, his successor, Rajiv Kumar, says it is difficult but doable.\n\nThe deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The economy decelerated and voters correctly placed the blame on the UPA government and voted it out. Rahul Gandhi is absolutely correct in accepting the mistake on behalf of the then ruling party and saying that it needs to be corrected. Panagariya is too good an economist to ignore the non-corporate sector and its importance in the economy when the corporate sector is less than a tenth of the economy. In terms of output and employment, the non-corporate sector is important because jobs are created there. But for the sake of debating points, the fact that the national accounts data doesn’t show a rosy picture and includes performance of the non-corporate sector, was slurred over. Yashwant Sinha has also started a debate and in a piece in these columns established that the reversal of the slowdown was simply not there.\n\nS. Gurumurthy had the courage to say that since Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s days, employment has been on the back burner. Half a problem is solved if a mistake is admitted and an amendment is made. But the empire struck back. On Rahul, a commentator close to the establishment said that speeches in America won’t matter in eastern UP. Another said that Berkeley and the Ivy League schools don’t matter. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and also taught there, including at Wharton and Swarthmore College. Working as I do in Gujarat from 1968, I hold the motel owner-NRIs in high esteem. Many are engineers and so on, who went into motels since other options were not there when they settled in America, and being intelligent and well-trained, made a success of them. But the Ivy League and the professional crowd is also important, have strong connections at home and their opinion is respected in India. In fact, they remain more often than not more connected with India than the motel NRIs and so should definitely not be ignored.\n\nSinha asked the beleaguered establishment to get back to the drawing board. One commentator strangely argued that he was wrong because real rural wages have been rising. Abhijit Sen, now back at JNU, had pointed out a decade ago that the rural wage rate is rising but unemployment is there in a big way. This conundrum needs to be worked on rather than being wished away. Another commentator was to argue that imports are rising so Sinha must be wrong, but we are a continental economy. A senior minister could only abuse Sinha; strange since the finance and planning ministries have been known for their professional stance.\n\nOne can only hope that the policy response will be more professional. The so-called stimulus package should not just give us lectures on reform. Someday, we will get to one or maybe two rates and have a real GST, which then, after six months, will start working. Until then, we can call it a GST but with five rates it’s not unlike a sales tax. Some day, the demonetisation effects will wear off. Also please don’t end it all by telling the ministries to spend more efficiently based on existing financial allocations. If reports are correct, the captive secretary saying ‘yes sir’ must have gone out sniggering.\n\nEfficiency doesn’t improve by lectures. Assuming that working styles will remain more or less the same, design a real stimulus. If you do your job and raise demand, the economy will respond magnificently.\n\nFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

    "comment" : " In case of paywall\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nNearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation as a sound economic manager.\n\nOn Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India’s two highest-denomination currency bills—1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees—would immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.\n\nThe long-term effects of India’s demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.\n\nInstead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India’s current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.\n\nThe policy’s shabby implementation—through an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes—undercuts Mr. Modi’s reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India’s notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.\n\nDemonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India’s central bank. And it forced many of the country’s ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.\n\nNot surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees’ worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.\n\nIndia’s economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there’s no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi’s competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister’s faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the “minimum government” he once promised.\n\nIt also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.\n\nAlready, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister’s image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization “a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.” For Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi’s “clumsy exercise of state power” won’t achieve its ostensible aim—cracking down on so-called “black money” salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy “poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.”\n\nTo be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati calls it “a courageous and substantive economic reform” whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.\n\nOthers argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.\n\nPerhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.\n\nTwo and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India’s great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.\n\n > It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.\n\nTime to bury the myth of competent Modi once and for all. Modi is totally out of his depth ffs. He's so incompetent. This is some Rahul Gandhi level shit Modi will probably start a war with Pakistan soon to distract everyone. The country’s bungling effort to cut down on cash has undermined Narendra Modi’s credibility, says Sadanand Dhume in The Wall Street Journal.\n\n---\n\n> * Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow.\n\n> * Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills.\n\n> * But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modis reputation as a sound economic manager.\n\n> * On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that Indias two highest-denomination currency bills1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupeeswould immediately cease to be legal tender in most...\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme Who is the telegenic yoga guru?

Wow! Must Read. what a wonderful article with data-driven. **is Mint the best Newspaper in India?** #How India fared under Indira Gandhi\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2016/11/30/Photos/Processed/indiragandhi2-ku0H--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)\n\n___\n\nOn 19 November, the Congress party kick-started celebrations to commemorate the birth centenary year of Indira Gandhi (hereafter referred to as Gandhi).\n\nAt a time when BJP is championing the image of prime minister Narendra Modi as a strong and decisive leader, the Congress party would be hoping to use Gandhi’s legacy to counter the ruling party and prime minister.\n\nIn an interview to India Today Television, Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed theories which equate Narendra Modi and Gandhi. While there is nothing new in the political slugfest being played out, a more interesting question is how should one evaluate Gandhi’s economic policies?\n\nTo analyse the performance of the Indian economy under Gandhi’s leadership, we have divided the post-independence period into three parts: 1952-1966, 1966-1984 and 1984 onwards. Gandhi was the prime minister from 1966-84 barring the period from 1977-1980. A simple comparison of growth rates shows that agricultural growth under Indira Gandhi’s tenure is the highest India has ever achieved. While overall growth rates have increased overtime in India, industry’s performance was the worst during Gandhi’s tenure.\n\nIn terms of per capita incomes, India started lagging behind China and southeast Asia when Gandhi was at the helm of affairs.\n\nGandhi’s own political rhetoric was more tilted towards providing a welfare state rather than delivering high growth, exemplified in her coining of the slogan Garibi Hatao (Eradicate Poverty). A reading of multiple Indian poverty estimates shows that poverty has declined at a much faster rate in post-reform India despite the dismantling of many of Gandhi’s policies. To be sure, there is a big debate on whether India’s current poverty lines guarantee adequate consumption and well-being levels. However, there is a broad agreement on the fact that poverty has declined faster in post-Gandhi India.\n\nOne statistic, which underlines the need for exercising caution vis-à-vis the positive picture painted by declining poverty figures is the rapid rise in inequality in India in the post-reform period. In fact, India was a more equal society than southeast Asia during Gandhi’s period. This trend has reversed itself today.\n\nIf there is one policy implemented by Gandhi which has left the most enduring impact on India’s political economy, it is the nationalisation of banks, which created a huge public sector bank network in India. The process was accomplished in two stages, first in 1969 and later in 1980.\n\nPublic sector banks have played a major role in the current problem of bad loans which plagues the Indian economy. Given the nexus between politicians controlling banks and businessmen, bank nationalisation policy is seen as a major culprit for the bad loan problem facing the Indian economy today. Public sector rigidities have also been seen as an obstacle to hiring talented executives and improving efficiency in India’s state owned banks.\n\nHowever, it is also a fact that nationalisation of banks helped in furthering financial inclusion and improved access to institutional credit for people who did not have access to it earlier. Financial intermediation increased sharply in the post-nationalisation period. The state-led expansion of banking also helped in a doubling of savings rate in the economy from 10 percent in 1970s to 20% in 1980s. An increase in savings rate is seen as a crucial requirement for increasing investment and growth rate in any economy.\n\nCaution should be observed in a mechanical reading of the statistics cited above as many policies often affect the economy with a lag. In fact, various economists have pointed towards the need to understand the complexities of political economy factors which drove economic growth in India. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian argues that the pro-business shift in Gandhi’s policies post 1980 was crucial in the growth rate picking up in the Indian economy. Similarly, a 2003 paper by Niti Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya argues that acceleration in India’s GDP growth occurred during India’s fifth five year plan period (1974-79), while underlining the fact that growth revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s was more volatile in nature than the post-reform period.\n\nAt a time when India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, it is to be expected that the incumbent regimes would claim credit for the economic performance and dismiss the socialist rhetoric of the past of which Gandhi is an important icon.\n\nHowever, it also remains a fact that despite faster growth, India stills lags behind most peers in human development outcomes.\n\nThe economic boom in southeast Asia and China helped these countries to significantly improve their human development indicators. Today, these countries are significantly ahead of India in terms of health and education levels. In fact, this gap started widening during the period when Gandhi was in power (see chart above). It remains to be seen whether a shift from Congress’s Garibi Hatao to Modi’s Cash Hatao will break this jinx.\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) Free market economics > Socialism.

The article did not mention the role of Govt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5FRuMkQ6g That's the classical liberal or libertarian point of view, espoused by the Chicago School of Economics. That would be minarchism, neo-liberalism isn't necessarily the Austrian school.  This isn't really a question for economists but more for political scientists, but that's just semantics. \n\nNeo-liberal refers to the 'original' liberalism, that is the liberalism that developed during the 17th-18th century that advocated for government to have limited power and to vest greater power in the individual. Theoretically this means the government serves as minimal a role as possible- upholding laws through courts and police forces, providing national defence, etc.\n\nThe issue is that 'law and order' as 'justice' are broad terms that aren't clearly defined. For instance, you can and people have argued that banning alcohol is a government move to uphold law and order, as less drunkards will cause trouble or beat their wives or commit assault. You can argue that reservation policies are a policy to uphold justice, to correct the injustice of generations of caste discrimination and such. \n\nNaturally neo-liberalism vests a lot of power and freedom in the private sector. That said, anti-trust and pro-competition regulations are another key role for the government to play.  When Jhootly and call drop mantri fails to auction spectrum to its potential and loot the exchequer. /s Govt Role - Providing basic services like public transport,good roads, water and electricity (which can be contracted to private players) and govt. schools and maybe govt. universities\n\nFederal Govt. - National Security, Defence and Foreign Policy and helping states in facilitating economic growth and fund central universities, access to afordable healthcare (doesn't mean running govt. hospitals) and enforce contracts and regulate.\n\nState Govt. - Law and order, ensuring the above services are delivered, fund state universities and ensure facilitation of economic growth by removing roadblocks for businesses, slash redtape, repeal redundant state laws and enforce the laws.\n\nAll other economic activity like running companies must be done by private players. That's the conservative way of thinking, not liberal.",

    "comment" : " ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Moving towards an investment revival** \n\n ______ \nIs corporate investment finally stirring to life? There are now a few silver\nlinings in what continues to be a dark sky. These rays of hope deserve more\nattention than they are getting right now.\n\nIn its latest monetary policy statement released in early February, the\nmonetary policy committee of the Indian central bank said, as part of its\ncomments on the outlook for the Indian economy, that there are early signs of\n“a revival in investment activity”. The panel that sets interest rates\nbelieves the revival in global demand should help strengthen domestic\ninvestment. Earlier, the World Bank had said in its June update on the global\neconomy that gross domestic capital formation—or investment—would overtake\nprivate consumer spending in fiscal year 2019 as the main driver of Indian\neconomic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been expecting\na private sector investment recovery in the next fiscal year.\n\nMuch of this seems to fly in the face of an overwhelming fact: Indian industry\nis still struggling with the problem of overcapacity. The production\nfacilities frenetically built during the previous economic boom have run into\nthe problem of weak domestic demand. However, the first synchronized recovery\nin the global economy since the financial crisis could provide the export\ndemand needed for Indian companies struggling with excess capacity.\n\nThe industrial outlook surveys conducted every quarter by the Reserve Bank of\nIndia (RBI) continue to show capacity utilization at a little over 70%. This\nnumber needs to increase by at least 10 percentage points before companies get\nback into investment mode. It is also widely known that the twin balance sheet\nproblem, or the mirror images of excess corporate leverage and a mountain of\nsoured bank loans, is a huge obstacle for private investment. Companies are\nmore focused on using cash flows from operations as well as asset sales to\nreduce debt rather than invest in new capacity.\n\nHowever, the global data is more reassuring. Many large economies have seen a\nstrong revival in corporate investment over the past few months, and it would\nbe unusual if Indian corporate investment did not pick up, though a lot\ndepends on what happens to the structural overcapacity in China as a result of\nits investment bubble. The big policy gamble taken by the Donald Trump\nadministration in the US—of a large fiscal stimulus despite tight labour\nmarkets—could blow another global bubble unless monetary policy is tightened\nrapidly. But for now it will fuel strong global demand.\n\nMuch of the early data in India suggests that the game right now is capacity\nexpansion rather than building new facilities. The Mark To Market column\npublished in this newspaper cited the order trends in capital goods companies\nsuch as ABB India, Siemens and Thermax to argue that brownfield investments\nare seeing a recovery. There is less action as far as greenfield investments\ngo. The index of industrial production also suggests that capital goods\nproduction is growing at a healthy clip, though it must be reiterated that\nthis segment of the factory output data is notoriously volatile.\n\nThere is widespread agreement that India cannot have sustainable growth\nacceleration unless private sector investment picks up. The economy has till\nrecently been very heavily dependent on consumer spending plus public\ninvestment by the government. The two other drivers of aggregate\ndemand—corporate investment and exports—have struggled. It is for this reason\nthat the recent green shoots are important.\n\nA bit of recent economic history would help clarify why a recovery in private\nsector investment matters for India. The two important economic booms in the\n26 years since the 1991 economic reforms tell us an important story. Be it the\n1994-97 acceleration or the one between 2004-08, it is clear that a\ncombination of a strong global economy plus a private sector investment boom\nis needed to lift the underlying trend economic growth on a sustainable basis.\nConsumer spending and government expenditure alone can take economic growth so\nfar—but no further.\n\nStrong export growth to complement the recovery in domestic demand could help\ncompanies deal with excess capacity. The deleveraging of corporate balance\nsheets as well as the recapitalization of public sector banks can create space\nfor the financing of new industrial capacity. The battle against the\ninvestment slump is far from over—but there is now reason to hope that the\nworst is over.\n\n_Will the global economic recovery revive investments in India ?

The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid in 2019.\n\nThe South Asian nation’s most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. That’s a significant change from the current system where the latest numbers are at least one-year old.\n\nMore From Livemint »\n\n“This data will bridge a huge gap,” said Pronab Sen, country director at the New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician. “This survey will give us an idea of the size of the GDP of India’s informal sector — there’s no other major economy with such high levels of informality,” he said. More than 90% of workers exist in the grey economy — unaccounted for in any official statistics — which complicates efforts to track unemployment.\n\nIndia has so far lacked a reliable policy tool in the form of real-time employment numbers to help policy makers and its central bank. Labour is governed by both federal and state governments and data collection is scattered, with seven federal agencies publishing reports, according to the Statistics Ministry.\n\nPoll promises\n\nBefore sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers — more than half of the population — with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created. While his critics say Modi’s biggest failure so far has been his inability to increase formal employment, officials in his government say the claims of jobless growth are a “bit bogus.”\n\nBloomberg\n\nFailure could risk voter backlash over jobs — an issue already driving protests in some parts of the country — and lead to even more divisive campaigning in the lead up to the country’s national elections.\n\n“The nation will come to know whether prime minister Modi has been able to fulfill his electoral promise of creating jobs,” said Satish Misra, an analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. “It will be an answer to India’s unemployment puzzle.”\n\nJagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t return calls seeking comment.\n\nDisappearing employment\n\nWhile India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.\n\nBloomberg\n\nThe government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires, according to Rakesh Kumar, additional director general of the National Sample Survey Office.\n\nMore than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labour data for the first time, Kumar said. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year.\n\nData delinquency\n\nThe survey may also be the first set of comparable economic data from India since 2015 when Modi’s government initiated changes to how the nation plots economic indicators like inflation and gross domestic product. Policy makers and economists have puzzled over new GDP and inflation calculations that catapulted India to become the world’s fastest-growing major economy.\n\nThe picture was muddled further in November last year after the prime minister overnight cancelled 86% of currency in circulation.\n\nWith its landmark goods and services tax launched on 1 July, calculations used to compile GDP and inflation data are also expected to be out of sync for at least a few months.\n\nYet, in a country where fewer than 5% of people declare their incomes and 1% pay income tax, the GST will help improve GDP calculations by making available high quality, granular data, according to Neelkanth Mishra, managing director and India equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.\n\nTimely release\n\nIndia’s decision to use Soviet-style five-year plans to plot its economy is another reason for the country’s data delinquency, Mishra said in a phone interview from Mumbai. Modi replaced those plans with a three-year strategy released earlier this year by the government’s planning body NITI Aayog, which discusses “high-productivity, high-wage jobs”.\n\nYet, there’s some apprehension about whether the government will keep to its timetable to release the labour survey. The task force formed last month under NITI Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended an employment survey every three years.\n\n“It seems the data may not go in his government’s favour as there is not much evidence of job creation because of slow down of economy and demonetisation,” said ORF’s Misra about whether Modi will release the jobs survey findings next December. “In that case he will not allow the data to be released few months before the election — if he releases, it will be a bold step.” Bloomberg\n\nArchana Chaudhary, Bibhudatta Pradhan\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

He enforced a very isolating policy. \n\nOn the other hand Duterte called Obama \"son of  a whore\" twice, and Trump, well he's said \"global warming is a Chinese hoax\" to be laughing stock of the world. Because Modi has been doing well in foreign policy. His fuck-ups are primarily domestic. Also, botching demonetisation cannot be compared to the bloodletting in the Philippines. \n\nTrump also gets enormous amount of attention because the US is the only superpower in the world. Aside from that, he has a habit of overtweeting about foreign policy. He just sent US/China relations into a tizzy because of his stance on Taiwan over a few tweets.\n\nModi is not more competent than they are, but India still has a lower profile than either. The Philippines isn't as important than India, but the reason why Duterte gets attention is the China connection. Moving away from the US to China gets attention in the Western press, so they try to discredit him. It's a way of warning others.\n\nAlso, up until now, Modi had an aura of competence. If he keeps these fuckups going for a few more years, you'll see opinion turning. I'm already seeing NRIs writing self-serving articles how \"Modi is not like Trump at all\". Well, no, but the differences are not amazing either. Modi is, if anything, even more xenophobic than Trump. He constantly invokes foreigners as a weapon to bash others(as recently seen re: Pakistan against demonetisation critics, his dark insinuations about Sonia Gandhi and her foreign roots etc, his rants against Bangladeshi illegal immigrants during the 2014 election and so on. All Trumpian and then some) I still don't understand how he would've gotten that much respect in the first place, considering his dubious past. I would say he's close to Erdogan in that they're both right wing, but Modi is currently _passively_ right wing while Erdogan is _actively_ so, in a lot of ways. Duerte is a raving lunatic, so I don't think we've descended to that level. At least he never really publically admitted to have killed a person in cold blood. Trump, is vastly different from all the other four. He has no politics - he sways with the wind (read money). He is a joke, and I say that even after he got elected. All others are career politicians, who have long backgrounds in politics. But yes, I do think that overseeing such a disastrously executed policy must've gained him some disrepute.  Erdogan is a political laughing stock? What is the definition of laughing stock? Even people who laugh at Trump fear about him.\n\nWho is laughing at Dueterret? From when killing people in name of justice become laughing stock?\n\n I think he has been at least linked to them because the three have similar campaigning styles (uber-nationalist, savvy use of social media to drown out dissent, hyper-insensitive towards minorities, etc)\n\n[Here's an article which ran in US in run-up to Trump's election pointing out the similarities](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/opinions/india-election-lessons-richard/). Our policies doesn't dictate the world economics. Call it whatever you may, but people in the West don't care about anything about India on a day to day basis. \n\nSource: I live among them.",

Photo: Mint\n\nPoor macroeconomic management, both by the central bank and political regimes over the past several years, is leading India toward an imminent vicious cycle of low growth and high inflation, making it exceedingly vulnerable to emerging domestic and geopolitical risks. The low growth-high inflation scenario will lead to higher fiscal and current account deficits, consequent capital outflows, a weaker currency and a lack of confidence in the economy among investors. The authorities need to undertake meaningful structural reforms and loosen monetary and exchange rate policy at the earliest to arrest the decline before it culminates in an external and financial crisis. A loose fiscal policy (increased government expenditure) at this juncture with a likely low fiscal multiplier would be counterproductive and accelerate the pace of economic decline.\n\nEconomic growth in India has likely been lower than the 7% rate that has been estimated by the Central Statistical Authority for the past two-three years. A sustained 7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been inconsistent with other major indicators, including credit, investment, index of industrial production, and exports growth slowing for at least the past four years. A slower 5.7% official GDP growth in 2QFY18 is therefore not surprising. In fact, before the switch to a new series of GDP numbers in early 2015, GDP growth estimates were 4.7% for FY14, according to the old series. New methodology introduced in the new series raised them to 6.7% for FY14, inconsistent with other indicators. Amongst other flaws, value added in manufacturing, which has been consistently significantly higher than other indicators would suggest, is arrived at from a corporate financial database maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs. It would be impossible to arrive at a true measure of value added in manufacturing from financial accounting data for even a few large firms such as Reliance, especially in an era where production of goods and services is becoming increasingly integrated.\n\nEconomic output and growth depend mainly on productivity growth and on increases in labour and capital; most commentators mistakenly tend to focus instead on the uses of this output—consumption, investment and exports. Productivity growth, the main driver of growth, depends on structural reforms that would require better institutions and improving human skills.\n\nStructural reforms are reforms aimed at changing the structure of the economy to make it more market-oriented, and consequently efficient and productive. India needs to focus on reforms in several areas—liberalizing markets, legal, civil service, tax structure, financial sector, education, and labour, amongst others. In competitive markets, any price different from the market-determined one (e.g. controls such as minimum or maximum prices) leads to a decline in output, ensuring reduced GDP.\n\nTo foster higher economic growth and job creation, the authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector—domestic and foreign—to invest in India. Specifically, the innumerable controls on markets and administered prices need to be freed up, including food and agricultural prices, water, electricity, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, seeds and railways, amongst others that reduce output and lead to a misallocation of resources. The direct tax structure needs to be simple and transparent with retrospective taxes eliminated. Public sector banks need to be recapitalized and privatized. The education system needs to be opened up to investors—domestic and foreign—as a profit-making sector, both at the school and higher education levels. These are minimal measures to attract investments.\n\nThe inexplicably tight monetary policy of high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate have been damaging to the economy. The insistence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to engage in foreign exchange market intervention to maintain an overvalued currency has encouraged further volatile debt inflows. This has increased India’s external vulnerability and inhibited financial markets development.\n\nOverall, RBI’s high interest rate and overvalued exchange rate policy has hurt credit growth, especially to industry, hurt firm-level debt sustainability and in turn bank balance sheets, and damaged exports and domestic industry further via cheaper imports. India is the only major economy in Asia with a negative credit gap (deviation from trend), according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFiscal policy has largely been unimaginative and a tighter fiscal policy with tight monetary policy has meant no policy support for growth over the past several years. Tax policy has mainly been one of raising tax rates—excise duties on petrol and diesel mainly and service tax rates that have increased from 12% to 18% over the last three years. At the same time, little effort has been made to simplify tax rules; indeed, the new goods and services tax structure with multiple rates is the most complicated globally. This structure with a smattering of controls has kept money out of India.\n\nThe fiscal multiplier is low; around 0.3 for emerging economies, according to some estimates. This means an increased fiscal expenditure of Rs40,000 crore (0.3% of GDP) being mentioned in the press would yield a negligible additional growth of 0.1% to GDP, raising growth from 5.7% to 5.8%.\n\nThe costs of this misguided fiscal expansion (government expenditure) could be significantly high. It would not lead to sustainable growth or increased investments from the private sector. The larger fiscal deficit, along with slowing growth reducing tax revenue, and a consequent worsening fiscal situation would lead to more borrowing from the RBI. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation would lead to capital outflows, slowing the economy further, draining liquidity from the system and raising interest rates, further dampening economic growth.\n\nTo conclude, the government needs to undertake structural reforms on a war-footing to encourage investments to grow the economy and increase revenue growth. Interest rates need to be reduced by the RBI. Misadventures such as expansionary fiscal policy will not be sustainable and will lead to low growth, higher fiscal deficit, high inflation, less competitiveness that would trigger capital outflows and lead to an external and also a financial crisis if financial sector weaknesses are not addressed.\n\nRajan Govil is managing director at Marketnomix and a former International Monetary Fund economist.\n\nComments are welcome at theirview@livemint.com\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

The attention to the state of the Indian economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. Photo: AP\n\nLast week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.\n\nIf indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.\n\nBoth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.\n\nThe other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.\n\nSo while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.\n\nIt is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.\n\nAs such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.\n\nThis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.\n\nAlongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.\n\nIn a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).\n\nSimilarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.\n\n“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”\n\nIn the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.\n\nThe Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.\n\nEven though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.\n\nAnil Padmanabhan is executive editor of Mint and writes every week on the intersection of politics and economics.\n\nHis Twitter handle is @capitalcalculus.\n\nRespond to this column at anil.p@livemint.com.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

    "comment" : " ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**A credibility deficit in statistics** \n\n ______ \nThe Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on 29 May. This is the first estimate for a full year after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took over. The growth rate of GDP at 7.3% at constant prices is not only better than the last year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but also makes India the fastest growing economy in the world. At a time when the world economy is showing signs of slowing, the performance of the Indian economy judged by these numbers should be cause for cheer. The fact that India’s economy grew faster than China’s may give the impression that all is well, despite fears of rural distress across India.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody seems to be happy with these numbers. Not only has the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the red flag doubting these numbers in its policy review, even the finance ministry has advised caution while interpreting these numbers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to send a team to understand the new GDP numbers put up by the CSO. Even the financial media, which should have lapped up these numbers, has shown maturity while reporting them.\n\nIndia’s statistical agency is well-regarded not only in India but also internationally, but the new GDP numbers pose a serious challenge to its credibility. While the CSO did bring out an explanatory fact sheet, thus far, its attempts to explain these numbers have not worked—partly because the explanations have been largely in terms of accounting and the arithmetic of national accounting, with very little clarity on the nature of changes and the sources of divergence between the new series and the old series.\n\nIt is not the arithmetic that is being questioned; the very basis of growth that seems to be at variance with the optimistic picture being presented by the national accounts. The high growth rate of GDP is attributed largely to the better-than-average performance of services and manufacturing with agriculture, mining and construction showing deceleration. The growth rate of manufacturing at 7.1% is not only at variance with the growth rate of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 2.3% but is also at variance with the reported sales of automobiles, tractors and many other manufactured goods, all of which show deceleration in sales and production. For the record, sales of commercial vehicles last year declined by 2.8%.\n\nEven for the services sector, the growth rates appear far too optimistic. Profits of companies do not reflect this optimism; nor do sales figures, which are subdued compared with the numbers reported in the national accounts estimates. Other data, such as exports and investment data, are also at variance with the rosy picture presented by the CSO. Clearly, there is something missing as far as the GDP numbers are concerned. Quite simply, the whole is not the sum of parts as expected in an accounting sense.\n\nOne of the reasons offered by the CSO for the variance has been the change in methodology of arriving at these numbers. To keep up with international practices, the CSO changed the methodology of computing GDP and its aggregates. As a result, the manufacturing growth rate, which was earlier based on the IIP and the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data on volume and value-added growth, now also takes into account the advance tax filing data maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). This practice of using tax data extends to the services sector as well, unlike the earlier series which used volume-based indices.\n\nWhile the new series may be consistent with the best practices adopted internationally, doubts remain. These are not only related to the conceptual framework for measuring growth in sectors and sub-sectors of the economy but also to the coverage of the MCA database. This is particularly a problem of developing countries, where the informal/unorganized sector still constitutes a large part of the economy. Serious questions have also been raised by Prof. R. Nagaraj—a member of the committee which recommended the use of MCA data—not only on the completeness of the data but also the methodology adopted to blow up the estimates.\n\nIt is obvious that the new series raises far too many questions than it has answered so far. A reasonable approach to such drastic changes would have included a wider discussion among the academic community as well as media dissemination before the new series was adopted. By maintaining secrecy on these, the CSO has not only messed up its communication strategy but also done considerable damage to its credibility.\n\nThe matter is not only about statistical methods and estimates. The issue of national accounts is also fundamental to the understanding of what is happening to different sectors of the economy and the way different sectors respond to various policy measures. A discredited database not only does injustice to the statistical system of the country but also hinders policy response needed for long term growth by giving mixed signals.\n\nHimanshu is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University and visiting fellow at Centre de Sciences Humaines, New Delhi.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link. Article was posted in 2015 when the questions surrounding the new GDP 2011-12 series had been released. \n\nThe main criticisms were that Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth data was at odds with manufacturing growth in the 2011-12 series. The new IIP 2011-12 series released seems to reconcile these numbers and hence an upward revision. \n\nSecond, there has been no back series of GDP or GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) released based on 2011-12 prices. So essentially, we have estimates 2011-12 onwards and we have earlier estimates based on 2004-05 prices. We cannot directly compare these numbers as it's simply not a base shift, it is a shift in methodology. ",

    "comment" : " #Demonetisation may not give India long term benefits: Paul Krugman\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2016/12/03/Photos/Processed/paulkrugman1-kYRE--621x414@LiveMint.jpg)\n\n___\n\nNew Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.\n\nThe 2008 Nobel Prize-winning economist said there is a good case to be made for not having high-value currency notes, but noted that India’s “unusual move” of discontinuing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was only a one-time effort to flush out hoarded money, and not to eliminate the denominations forever.\n\n“I understand the motivation, but it is a highly disruptive way to do it. I hardly see significant long-run gains, but there certainly are significant, although temporary, costs,” Krugman, a professor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, said at the Hindustan Times Leadership summit.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November scrapped the high-denomination currency notes in a crackdown on unaccounted wealth, tax evasion, terror finance and counterfeit currency. The move took out 86% of the value of currency in circulation, and economists have warned that it would dent consumer demand in the short term, set back gains to agriculture from a bountiful monsoon and harm productivity.\n\nOne of the reasons for Krugman’s disapproval of demonetisation as part of a drive to tackle income tax evasion is his belief that it is practically difficult for developing economies with large unorganized sectors to raise the share of taxes as a proportion of GDP by relying too much on income taxes.\n\nAlso read: GST roll-out by September 2017 is a constitutional compulsion, says Arun Jaitley\n\nAlthough considered regressive, indirect taxes, such as the central excise duty and service tax levied by the central government in India and value added tax (VAT) by states, are more practical tools to raise tax revenue, he said. Indirect taxes are generally considered regressive as they affect the rich and the poor alike, unlike income tax, the burden of which increases progressively on tax payers with high income levels.\n\nIndia is now leading the discussions among G20 nations for a multilateral framework to prevent income tax evasion, especially corporate tax, based on principles laid down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed economies.\n\n“Trying to have an OECD style income tax system in a country which has a per capita GDP far below OECD levels is not doable,” Krugman said.\n\nThe American economist said India could be hit by a recession in China stemming from declining investment, but has no reason to worry about the US turning more protectionist under Donald Trump.\n\nKrugman said it would be difficult for China to sustain investments as a share of GDP and a readjustment can spell trouble for other economies including India.\n\n“China cannot continue its previous investment-driven growth model. How can you manage the large scale of adjustment without a massive recession?. China looks to me ready to blow up,” said Krugman.\n\nHe doesn’t see much of an impact on India from the US possibly taking steps to protect its jobs, including from the services sector in India.\n\n“I do not see a short-run macroeconomic crisis (in the US). If anything, policy will shift to fiscal expansion. Extremely unwise long-run policy does not necessarily carry a short-run cost. Economics is not a morality play. You can have bad policies turning out to be catastrophic a generation from now, but that does not necessarily bring a recession now. The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy,” said Krugman.\n\nHe added that not being a trade surplus country will work to India’s advantage in this context. The comment comes in the backdrop of US president elect Donald J Trump’s economic policies widely being taken to be protectionist and hence likely to rattle a still recovering global economy.\n\nKrugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.\n\nKrugman attributes the current weak global economic growth to a chronic weakness in demand, which was not the outcome of the asset bubble and financial crisis of 2008, but something which ran deeper.\n\n“There is a an underlying inadequacy in spending, which was masked by the asset bubble. The preponderance of evidence now is that this is the new normal that we need to live in a world which does not want to spend enough to keep itself fully employed,” Krugman said. “Unlike earlier thought, high level of public debt due to the economic stimulus that nations doled out in the last few years, now looks misplaced as interest rates are low.”\n\nKrugman also called for a big burst of fiscal expansion in the world economy after which one could think of resetting policies.\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) Paul Krugman says the way India has gone about demonetisation is a highly disruptive process\n\n---\n\n> * New Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.\n\n> * China looks to me ready to blow up, said Krugman.\n\n> * The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy, said Krugman.\n\n> * Krugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n> * [The Trouble With Trump's Infrastructure Plan](http://www.bloombergquint.com/view/2016/11/14/the-trouble-with-trump-s-infrastructure-plan)\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme",

    "comment" : " ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Calls to weaken rupee are misguided** \n\n ______ \nRather like Goldilocks, commentators on the Indian rupee don’t like the value of the currency too low or too high—they would like it just right. Thus, when the rupee is weak, there are complaints that it is too weak; with a strong rupee, there are complaints that it is too strong. It is understandable that industry shills should press for a weakening of the rupee. But it is not just those with a vested interest in promoting domestic industry who are crying foul— eminent economists have now joined the fray. In this newspaper, former chief economic adviser Deepak Nayyar and economist Ajit Ranade have batted for a weaker rupee in the past few weeks. Nayyar, in particular, is explicit that this is best achieved through lowering the policy interest rate, which, it is alleged, is too high.\n\nUnfortunately, such arguments suffer from the fallacy of thinking that the tail wags the dog. It is not that the rupee is too strong relative to the US dollar, but rather that the US dollar is weak—relative to a wide range of currencies, not just the rupee.\n\nThe figure shows a broad trade-weighted US dollar index from July 2016 to the present, and this clearly reveals that after a period of steady appreciation culminating approximately at the time that Donald Trump was inaugurated US president, the dollar has been steadily depreciating.\n\nThe rupee’s initial weakening followed by strengthening is a mirror image of this. Indeed, the dollar shows broadly similar behaviour vis-a-vis a range of advanced and emerging economy currencies. The fundamental driver is perhaps the market’s sense that Trump’s economic programme—tax cuts and infrastructure spending—is floundering. It is noteworthy that even with monetary tightening, the dollar has been weakening.\n\nThe real story is thus of dollar weakness, not rupee strength, and this turns the analysis on its head. For there is little if anything that Indian monetary authorities can—or should—do in the face of a fluctuating dollar, beyond attempting to smooth excess volatility. As it happens, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does intervene in currency markets, exactly for this reason, not to alter the underlying market-determined path of the exchange rate.\n\nThere is a second key proposition that critics miss. In a world of open capital markets, and in which the central bank wishes to pursue an independent monetary policy—in the case of India and many others, that choice is inflation targeting—we must, perforce, accept that the nominal exchange rate will be largely market-determined. In other words, you cannot simultaneously pursue an independent monetary policy and control the exchange rate—a fundamental insight that we owe to the Nobel economist Robert Mundell and to which many critics seem strangely oblivious.\n\nUnless critics would like India to abandon our inflation-targeting monetary policy regime and substitute it with a fundamentally different system, such as fixing the exchange rate to the US dollar or something else equally radical, they cannot simultaneously grumble about the interest rate and the exchange rate in an open economy.\n\nIt is perfectly possible to debate whether the global economy is in need of systemic monetary reform, but that is very different from suggesting that India, acting alone, should abandon inflation targeting in favour of a more exotic policy approach. And, if we accept inflation targeting, or indeed any conventional flexible exchange-rate monetary policy regime, we must accept that the value of the rupee will be basically market-determined, full stop.\n\nThe truth is this: Those at present batting for a lower policy rate and/or a weaker rupee are, it would appear, concerned primarily with the interests of domestic Indian industry, not Indian consumers— who stand to benefit from a stronger rupee to the extent that, for instance, they purchase foreign goods or travel abroad— or indeed the economy as a whole.\n\nLet us not forget that an artificially weakened currency can make up, at least for a while, for a multitude of sins, such as low productivity in domestic industry, and that is another reason why industry pushes for it. Why become more competitive and more efficient when, hey presto, your friendly neighbourhood central banker can bid down the value of the currency and let you stand on stilts for a while? This is an old trick. For instance, Canada for years cushioned low domestic productivity with a depreciated currency.\n\nThe RBI’s monetary policy committee is correctly focused on achieving the inflation-target mandate, and ought not to get distracted by the red herring that a strong rupee is hurting the economy.\n\nVivek Dehejia is a Mint columnist and resident senior fellow at IDFC Institute, Mumbai.

Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. “Some top Indian names are coming up” with dollar debt offerings, he said.The optimism around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies and prospects of outsized profits are proving hard to resist for bond bulls. Dollar-denominated debt from India has returned 5.68 percent this year, compared with 4.95 percent in China and 2.98 percent in South Korea, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.There’s more juice left in the rally, according to Anthony Leung, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.‘Good Value’India’s investment-grade company bonds “remains a pocket of good value” across Asia and the steps taken by Modi’s government are “steering the economy in the right direction,” he wrote in a Sept. 7 note. While challenges remain in cleaning up bad loans at banks, the start of an unified sales tax, abolition of subsidies and low oil prices will help offset the problems, he said.The policy measures are bearing fruit and will lead to the nation’s credit rating being raised by Moody’s Investors Service “within a year,” Leung said. A Moody’s spokesperson said the firm does not comment on third-party speculation on ratings.Rating firms have India just above “junk” status and while Modi’s government has pushed for an upgrade in the past few years, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have all pushed back, citing high debt levels.Green BondsThat said, the unexpected slowdown in growth hasn’t put investors off India’s corporate debt or slowed new issuance. Buyers have drawn confidence from the fact that the nation is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a strong political mandate gives Modi more policy flexibility to revive expansion.Power Finance Corp., a state-run lender to utilities, has sought bids from credit rating firms for its $1 billion medium-term notes. Bharat Petroleum Corp. plans to raise $500 million via Singapore-listed bonds, Director of Finance K. Sivakumar said Tuesday. State Bank of India plans to raise up to $3 billion in the nation’s biggest overseas green-bond issue, the Economic Times reported last week, citing an unnamed executive close to the initiative.“There’s more demand than supply for Indian bonds as investors bet on the outlook of the Modi-led economy,” said Bryan Wang, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Investment Trust Co. in Taipei.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

Given the fact that India is\npractically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that\ndozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of\ntheir governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government\ndeliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as\nstubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.\n\nWell, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign\npolicy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on\ngrounds that are both principled and realist.\n\nThe government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-\narticulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that\n\"connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility\nto avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;\nbalanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;\ntransparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to\nhelp long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local\ncommunities.\" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the\npath of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-\ninitiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were\nclearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the\nsustainability issues involved.\n\nWhile India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it\nis not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The\nGuardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the\nresolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental\nreasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of\n\"isolation\" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign\nup to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India\nis the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the\nsubject, and of that we can be proud.\n\nLet's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take\nadvantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free\ncountry and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian\nmanufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by\nChina, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.\nIt is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what\nOBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own\nposition in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will\nnot, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in\nparticular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on\ninfrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS\nBank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.\nThis is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently\nviolate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would\nfail to uphold.\n\nThis is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has\ntaken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In\nalmost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of\nManmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in\nsuch matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the\nSingh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's\nsensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:\nBeijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's \"core\ninterests\". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to\nthe Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-\nII, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact\nwith Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would\nalso have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit\nfrom the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's\nsensitivities.\n\nBy taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi\nhas done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand\non a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.\n\nThere are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is\nessentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and\neconomics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a\nleader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an\nalternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-\ndriven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's\nAmerica turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free\nmovement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles\neverywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.\n\nAnd second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this\nregard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which\nserve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries\nand economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,\nSingapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.\n\nModi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning\nto deliver. He must keep going.\n\n_(Mihir Swarup Sharma is a fellow at the Observer Research\nFoundation.)_**Disclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the\npersonal opinions of the author.

The attention to the state of the Indian economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. Photo: AP\n\nLast week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.\n\nIf indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.\n\nBoth are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.\n\nThe other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.\n\nSo while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.\n\nIt is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.\n\nAs such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.\n\nThis potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.\n\nAlongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.\n\nIn a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).\n\nSimilarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.\n\n“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”\n\nIn the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.\n\nThe Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.\n\nEven though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.\n\nAnil Padmanabhan is executive editor of Mint and writes every week on the intersection of politics and economics.\n\nHis Twitter handle is @capitalcalculus.\n\nRespond to this column at anil.p@livemint.com.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

However inflation is running below central banks’ targets. The recent data on inflation shows that there is a pickup in inflation but it still remains below desired levels in most developed economies.The minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee’s June policy discussions shower a split over inflation. Minutes from the ECB released indicated that the ECB was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling market. The news of shifting monetary policy trajectories of central banks have led to the volatility in both stock market and Forex market.The Bank of Japan and the European Central banks are scheduled to meet on July 20 and Fed interest rates decision is scheduled on July 26. Though Fed Chair Yellen has said that the US economy is healthy enough for the Fed to proceed with plans to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, but it is expected that Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes down the road and interest rates would remain historically low over the longer term.Emerging economies including India have undoubtedly been benefited from the environment of lower interest rates.Among all major economies, the interest rate regime in India only is on a downward trajectory.Meanwhile, recent data pointed to slowing industrial production growth and to a falling retail price inflation has given room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resort to accommodative stance from neutral at the review meeting on August 2.The markets know that the long period of low rates has to end sometime and a gradual normalisation of policy rates may not necessarily impact the stock markets. However, a sudden change in yield expectations may cause volatility in the market. As the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong, any inorderly tapering by the major central bankers would have limited impact on the Indian stock market.So, it is advised to use any dip into the market as buying opportunity and remain invested for long term as India is a bright spot among its peer though its valuation looks rich.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.",

    "comment" : " ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Is the golden age over for emerging markets?** \n\n ______ \nThe answer to that question is probably yes, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A chapter in its latest World Economic Outlook warns emerging economies they can no longer count on the benign external environment that had led to high economic growth in their economies in the last few decades.\n\nIt warns of “fading external tailwinds, including waning potential growth in advanced economies, slowdown and rebalancing in China, and a shift in the commodity cycle that has affected commodity exporters”. It says that, “Together with a risk of protectionism in advanced economies and tighter financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes, these changes make for a more challenging external environment for emerging market and developing economies going forward.”\n\nThe chart paints a broad picture. It shows how the contribution of emerging markets to world growth increased from 18.2% during 1976-79 to 69.82% during 2010-15. The contribution of developing countries to world consumption rose even more markedly—from 13.9% during 1976-79 to 72% in 2010-15. But the rise of emerging markets is an old story. What’s new are the projections—the IMF forecasts that the contribution of emerging economies to both global growth and consumption will decrease during the period 2016-2021, as the chart indicates. True, the decrease is not much, but it does mark a turning point from the hefty increases of earlier decades.\n\nHow important are external conditions for growth in emerging markets? The IMF article says a 1 percentage point increase in domestic absorption by a country’s trading partners translates into around a fifth of the annual average growth in GDP per capita in emerging markets. And secondly, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital flows to GDP of emerging market and developing economies raises medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points.\n\nTaken together with higher growth on account of better terms of trade for commodities, the IMF estimates that over the past two decades, these factors accounted for more than half of medium-term growth, on average, across emerging market and developing economies. In turn, about half of the contribution to growth from external factors is due to higher capital inflows to emerging markets.\n\nWill India too be affected? Well, India is one of those countries where domestic demand has been the mainstay of growth. But we shouldn’t underestimate the important part that external demand has played in supplementing that growth. One very important element of India’s liberalisation story and of its growth pick-up after liberalisation is the increase in its share of exports of goods and services to GDP from 6.8% in 1990-91 to 25% in 2013-14. The most rapid spurt happened in the early noughties, during the period of the global boom, when the ratio went up from 12.6% in 2001-02 to 23.7% in 2008-09.\n\nAs the IMF report says, “a favourable impulse from external demand and financial conditions helps medium-term growth outcomes by making growth accelerations more likely. It also reduces the likelihood of growth reversals.”\n\nThat’s not all. The rise in fund flows to the Indian stock markets during the noughties led to a boom in the secondary and primary equity markets, allowing companies to raise capital easily and lowering their cost of capital. This, in turn, sparked an investment boom and also led to higher employment, higher wages and consequently, to higher consumption. As the IMF says, “Capital inflows can enhance growth in emerging market and developing economies through various channels: augmentation of funds available for investment, transmission of crucial know-how and technological diffusion, and adoption of market discipline and better governance practices.”\n\nGiven the importance of the external sector, what then can be done to mitigate the impact of the headwinds mentioned above? The IMF believes that, faced with a potentially less supportive external environment than in the past, emerging market and developing economies can get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks and adopting a policy mix that protects trade integration; permits exchange rate flexibility; and ensures that vulnerabilities stemming from high current account deficits and external debt, as well as high public debt, are contained.\n\nThese are all standard text-book remedies, but complying with them will be all the more important in a less benign external environment.\n\nThe markets, fixated perhaps on the short term, seem to be ignoring these long-run risks outlined by the IMF. As a recent Bank for International Settlements paper by Luis Awazu Pereira de Silva and Elod Takats says, “We are witnessing a departure from the policies of trade integration and multilateral cooperation that have been our successful recipe for the last 50 years. Is it purely rhetorical or real? Temporary or lasting? Is it linked to the current backlash against globalisation? Therefore, there is a disconnect between market exuberance and policy uncertainty. There are indeed threats to trade, financial integration and international cooperation that benefited both AEs and EMEs. These threats are increasing.”\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

Any assessment of its economic performance should take into account what it inherited. India faced a near-crisis situation in 2013. Inflation had spun out of control. Public finances were a mess. The rupee was in free fall. Confidence was low owing to corruption scandals and economic mismanagement by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the years leading to the 2014 general election.\n\nIndia has come a long way since then. The most important economic policy achievement of the past three years has been macroeconomic stability. Inflation is now under control. There has been a tentative recovery in economic growth. The balance of payments is comfortable. Part of this can be explained by the steep decline in global energy prices, but the retreat from loose monetary and fiscal policies has also been an important reason why the Indian economy is no longer fragile.\n\nThe reforms record has been a more mixed one—especially since Modi spoke on the campaign trail about minimum government and maximum governance.\n\nThe Modi government should be satisfied that the stage is now set for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). Even the flawed GST we are beginning with will boost overall efficiency in the economy. India now has a new monetary policy framework. The passage of the bankruptcy code will lead to more efficient allocation of capital. However, these policy initiatives were inherited from the UPA regime. The Modi government needs to now craft its own reforms playbook for the next decade.\n\nThere have been some important initiatives. A new fiscal framework is in the works. High-level corruption has almost disappeared. The auction of natural resources has been done in a transparent manner. The government has also taken a number of steps to check the flow of black money. However, the most radical move made by the Modi government was the withdrawal of high-value banknotes in November 2016. The benefits of the move are not yet clear, and will only be known in the years ahead.\n\nThe government has managed to bring down the fiscal deficit while increasing capital expenditure. A recent report by Deutsche Bank showed that government expenditure led by capital expenditure increased in the last two years of the term of every government since 1991, with the exception of UPA-II, when expenditure went up in the last year. However, barring UPA-I, higher expenditure did not result in a corresponding increase in the fiscal deficit. It will be important for the Modi government to stick to the stated fiscal path, and not indulge in a spending spree like the UPA, as it could compromise the hard-won macroeconomic stability.\n\nAlong with maintaining fiscal discipline, the government will have to continue to work in areas that are holding back the economy. One of the reasons why growth has remained subdued in the last few years is the collapse in private sector investment. Policymakers have not been able to solve the twin balance sheet problem. A coherent strategy to clean up banks is still not in evidence. Privatization of public sector banks should be seriously considered.\n\nAlso, all efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate bond market in order to channelize long-term finance for Indian companies. This will also help boost activity in the infrastructure sector where private sector investment has been missing, partly because of the reluctance of banks to lend. An investment revival is critical for higher growth.\n\nThe government should now work on the next level of reforms. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government managed to do a lot of things in the latter half of its tenure. For instance, the fiscal responsibility and budget management rules and pension reforms were implemented towards the end of its tenure. The looming political risk is that the job creation needed to maintain social stability cannot be addressed without reforms in factor markets. The complex web of laws does not allow enterprises to grow. The next level of reforms should simplify laws in the land and labour markets, which will significantly improve the ease of doing business in the country.\n\nFinally, Modi should know by now that India is being held back by inadequate state capacity. The government does too much in some areas; and it does too little in others. It needs to build capabilities to manage the fastest growing large economy in the world—but not fall into the interventionist trap that it so often seems to be doing these days.\n\nRecent history has clearly demonstrated that economic growth is the best solution for poverty alleviation and improving standards of living. Therefore, the challenge for the Modi government would be to take the Indian economy to a sustainable high growth path. And the next two years will be as important, if not more so, than the past three years.\n\nWhat should the Modi government do to increase the rate of growth?

Niti Aayog has proposed an award scheme to incentivize people to use digital modes of payments. Last week, the government announced several measures—such as discounts at petrol pumps and on rail tickets, and insurance policies sold by public sector insurance companies—to boost digital transactions.\n\nThere is indeed merit in reducing the usage of cash in the economy as electronic transactions, among other things, leave a trail and make tax avoidance more difficult. However, moving towards a more cashless society is a medium-to-long term goal. The government’s present urgency to turn the ongoing currency swap into a major push to make India a cashless economy must be seen keeping this in mind.\n\nALSO READ | Watal panel moots independent payments regulator\n\nTo be sure, the narrative of the currency exchange programme has changed significantly in the last one month. It was conceived and launched as an attack on black money and counterfeiting of currency notes, but the objective now seems to have shifted to making India a cashless economy. This newspaper supported the idea of the currency swap as part of a bouquet of policies against tax evaders. It was clear from the word go that this would only attack a part of the stock of black money that is stored in cash. But the incoming evidence suggests that many tax evaders have actually managed to launder their illicit wealth. A large number of new bank notes being recovered by the authorities in various parts of the country and a massive surge in deposits in Jan-Dhan accounts are cases in point. Clearly, the implementation of the currency exchange has left much to be desired. Effectiveness of policy also depends on implementation; ideas alone don’t lead to desired outcomes.\n\nIt now appears that the amount of currency notes that will not return to the banking system was overestimated. This perhaps explains the pivot to the cashless theme. As Praveen Chakravarty of IDFC Institute highlighted in these pages on Monday, Prime Minister Narender Modi mentioned “black money” 18 times in his initial speech on 8 November and did not talk about cashless or digital economy. However, in two speeches that he gave on 27 November, he mentioned “cashless” and/or “digital” 24 times, but black money came in only nine times. The excessive amount of time being taken to replace the currency notes and persistent queues in front of banks and ATMs may also have prompted the government to push for digital transactions.\n\nALSO READ | Regulating the digital payment industry\n\nHowever, the government would be well-advised to not depict the transition to a more cashless economy as the main objective behind the currency reform. The overwhelming public support that the government got after the withdrawal of high-value notes was for the attack on black money and not for making transactions cashless.\n\nReducing the role of cash in the system is a worthy goal, but it cannot be the driving force for this policy as it now appears to have become. As noted in this editorial, the move towards a more cashless system is a longer-term goal. There are practical problems on the way. A vast majority of Indians either don’t have bank accounts or the technological wherewithal to make or receive digital payments. Many of them belong to the same aspirational middle and neo-middle class that supported the move as an attack on black money and corruption.\n\nFurthermore, digitization alone will not justify the political and economic risk attached to the currency swap. The latest high-frequency economic indicators such as auto sales and Purchasing Managers’ Index for both services and manufacturing shows that economic activity has been affected, though the actual overall impact will only be known in the coming months. In terms of the political impact, the renewed friction between the government and the opposition has resulted in almost the entire winter session of Parliament being wasted, and it now appears that meeting the 1 April deadline for the implementation of the goods and services tax will be extremely difficult.\n\nSince the government has taken a big political risk, it should avoid moving the goalposts. Changing the narrative of the currency swap could affect the government’s credibility and make it more difficult to take tough decisions. It will be a long-drawn-out battle against black money and action will be required on various fronts. Not all of it will be successful.\n\nWill changing the narrative of currency swap affect the government’s credibility?

We liberalized our economy 13 years after China did the same. This is the only reason.  A good article and the comments for the article is even more interesting. I think one of the big reasons is that the Chinese government has an almost totalitarian grip over the country.\n\nWhat this means is, for example if they are making a bridge and they need permission from some people to raze their houses to make way, the government decides how much they will be compensated, when they have to vacate and if the homeowner goes against that, he is thrown in jail.\n\nThus a lot of daily hurdles that the Indian government has, the Chinese don't.\n\nLooking so far back as the British is of no use. In 1960 India was doing better than China on all parameters. Technological dominance came later. Nauroji's argument holds because the British actually took wealth out of India, and used it to finance other ventures, including development of technology. Also, it is very unclear what the author is trying to say. The article could be written a lot clearer than it has been.",

I think India should focus on competing them at that level, rather than doing something because it's anti-China, IMHO. Slightly off topic but in Mongolia, they drink horse's milk.

The official requested anonymity.\n\nLast year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.\n\n“Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets,” Jaitley said in his budget speech last year.\n\nALSO READ | Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?\n\nThis year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.\n\nInvestment demand in the economy is expected to contract in 2016-17 by 0.2% from 3.9% growth in 2015-16, according to data released by the government’s statistics department earlier this month.\n\nThe investment scenario further worsened after 8 November when the government invalidated high-value currency notes. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) data released earlier this month showed a sharp fall in new investment proposals in the October-December quarter to Rs1.25 trillion, compared with an average of Rs2.36 trillion worth of new investments seen per quarter in the preceding nine quarters that the Narendra Modi government has been in power.\n\nClearly, investors have been spooked.\n\nD.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, said the economy needs a “substantial fiscal stimulus” to revive growth, which had started slowing even before demonetization. “Government can revise upward its fiscal deficit target for next fiscal to 3.5% of GDP from 3% of GDP under the existing fiscal consolidation roadmap. Beyond that it can allow states to borrow more for capital investments.”\n\nALSO READ | Should the budget stray from straight and narrow path of fiscal consolidation?\n\nThe government may be helped by the recommendations of a committee set up under former secretary in the finance ministry and Bharatiya Janata Party member N.K. Singh to suggest a new roadmap for fiscal consolidation. The committee, which was appointed in May last year, was asked by the finance ministry to examine the need and feasibility of aligning fiscal expansion or contraction with credit contraction or expansion, respectively, in the economy. It has also been asked to examine the feasibility a “fiscal deficit range” . The committee is expected to submit its report on Thursday.\n\nThe government official cited earlier said one of the key reasons behind advancing the budget presentation by a month is to give more time to key infrastructure departments such as railways, highways and urban development to implement larger projects as more funds will be made available to them.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi last month told economists at the NITI Aayog that advancing the date of presentation of the Union budget will help speed up investment expenditure in the productive pre-monsoon months.\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.6a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) The govt looks to spur the economy through higher public investment in infrastructure, at a time when private investment is showing no signs of a pick-up\n\n---\n\n> * New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.\n\n> * There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government.\n\n> * Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.\n\n> * This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n> * [Forecast foibles](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/KUeuQHrjOTSIdHHhjt0CBL/Forecast-foibles.html)\n\n> * [GST rate structure finalised, majority of items in 12% and 18% tax slabs](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/OuTNv0usNfIiRBklKa5B1O/GST-rates-to-be-between-5-and-28.html)\n\n---\n\n^I'm ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^\"delete\" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme",

We will work with USA for access to high end tech & invts into Indian econ & work with Russia for energy security & high end defense tech. India should stay firm on non-alignment policy. It had done more good than harm to India in the past, kept us out of unnecessary wars, helped in making new friends easily. I don't think any govt is going to fuck with that. Diplomatic relations are built upon years of work by diplomats staying in those countries. So why try to fix something that is not even broken and would take a lot of time.\n\nRussia is also not in any better condition. USA at least have businesses that provide work to Indian companies. Russia's economy is shrinking and they have put in a lot in Syria. A lot of how long they would continue that they are a superpower would depend on how long they can stretch this crisis. \n\n",

    "comment" : " I am not economist.Current GDP growth estimate by IMF is 4.7% some say actual was 3.5% while CPI inflation is 11.5 %. Indian economy is in total mess if they fail to fix it, it may have similar effect like Argentina. Fast growing China has inflation of 3%  UPA-1 did achieve some good economic figures.\nIt consequently won.. \n\nWhat we should truly evaluate is UPA-2?\n\nI guess the figures would be very different. \n\n\n\n This is a stupid way of presenting data. Why don't you just show the trend line? These tables are highly prone to misinterpretations. For example, UPA is a 10-year time period vs BJP, a 5 year time period. Best year GDP growth of 9.6 in UPA might be in 2004/2005/2006...which has absolutely no relevance to the disaster that UPA-II is today. It is very much possible that UPA-I reaped the benefits of BJP's policies. \n\nTL;DR: Just show us the trendline instead of cherry picking data. UPA I reaped the good sowing of NDA..UPA II is reaping the bad sowing of UPA I. In the NDA years, GDP growth was increasing, while in the UPA years, GDP growth turned negative. When NDA started their term, GDP was near 4-5% growth rate, when they ended, GDP growth was at 8.1%. When UPA started their term, GDP growth was at 8.x%, it peaked at 9% and is now down back to 4-5%. UPA-1 inherited a healthy economy from NDA. It was a ride while it lasted. \n\nUPA-2 suffered because of UPA-1.   So, effectively, UPA managed to magically turn every single rising graph into a falling graph. Spectacular. \n\nhttp://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/1612/table_2.pdf \n\nIn 1997-98 (Non NDA Gov), the GDP was 4.2%\n\nNDA boosted it 8.3% by 2003-04. This momentum was maintained in UPA 1 tenure [but later it you see the graph is moving downward.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) \n\nIn 1998, Infaltion was at 8.26%, by 2004 NDA brought it down to 2.80%. But UPA 1 boosted inflation to 8.70% by 2009 itself!\n\nUPA has been in office for 123 months now and the number of months for which the food inflation stayed above 10% is 78. Thats almost 63% of their total tenure.\n\nComparing to NDA, they lasted for 72 months, in which the food inflation stayed above 10% only for about 12 months i.e 17% of their tenure. \n\nNow, i don't know about food prices and other commodity prices, but they surely gone up by 90-900% since the UPA regime took over.\n\nTalking about Fiscal deficit, it was -6.29 in 1998-99, NDA reduced it to -3.88 by 2004. However post 2004, fiscal deficit kept on increasing and now its stands at - 5.15.\n\n\n [NDA had current account surplus in 2002, 2003, 2004 \\(Again as per above links\\). The current account deficit was -2 in 1998. NDA did a nice job and brought it to +2.3 in 2004 which UPA reduced to -5.15 at present. \n](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/current-account)\n\nRegarding jobs, NDA created ~61 million jobs, however UPA 1 could only managed to create 2.7million.\n\n \nAlso the savings rate was increased from 23.19% in 1998-99 to 32.41 by 2004. Now its 30.81. \n\nRegarding exchange rate, the depreciation was of 9% during NDA tenure. Its more than 35% during UPA tenure. \n\nAnd lastly, the above data of  showing average scores is basically to fool the voters. We were not hit hard by any recession (and this is not i am saying. It was said by Dr. Singh himself). \n\nSources: Mostly from tradingeconomics.com, RBI, Nassco, planning commission, Livemint claim check.  \n Inflation, price rise and massive unemployment neutralized most of the UPA's GDP growth rate and prevented it from actually reaching the people. Try this for perspective.\n\nhttp://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html\n\n>The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government. This is called being unambiguous with facts but being open with interpretation. Pretty much my employer's policy. wait... so why is UPA so bad? can i add the [R] tag here..",

A regime change was bought about certainly due to Indian influence which India will not confirm or deny. This will certainly has upset China, as Rajapakse was China's sweetheart. Modi's foreign policy is look east which IMHO will reap benefits.  This is the statement I have been barking from past 2 years everywhere , But I always get shitty replies -\" times have changed, we should forget Russia \" , \"we are democracies\", we are that or we are this. Simple thing No Super power will allow other countries to develop, which may challenge them, in 1970's they sucked Chinese to oppose soviet union, Now they want relations with India to stop china, tomorrow they do same thing against India with Pakistan .  In 2014, a slow year for the Indian economy, India grew at a rate of somewhere around 5%. (Estimates vary from 7-4.x, so 5% is a reasonable middle of the ground number.) \n\nThis meant an addition to Indian GDP of about 100 billion dollars. In comparison, Pakistan has an economy of around 245 billion dollars.\n\nSo in a bad year, India will add to its economy half a Pakistan, and in a good year, India will add to its economy one full Pakistan. In a decade or two, the relative economic disparity between India and Pak, which is at 10:1 today, will be around 20:1.\n\nHow can such a tiny power, that cannot keeps its own children safe, keep India in check? American strategic thinkers are many thing, but math illiterate they are not. \n\nForget these conspiracy theories peddled by foolish NAM types, and too clever by half hidden-Islamists, and venture forth boldly into the future.  I don't believe that the American political system is capable of long term/very long term foreign policy strategies this article proposes it's doing. \n\nAmerica's foreign policy is like any other country's foreign policy, just reacting to what pops up day to day.

    "comment" : " It's very hard to \"rank\" PMs like this, because a ranking suggests a single axis. Most PMs have mixed track records, good in some areas, crap in others. \n\nSince a lot of posters here are quite young, I'll try to cover some of the older PMs:\n\n * **Nehru**: [4/10]: His economic theories (Fabian socialism) made India suffer, some of his appointments were disastrous (Krishna Mennon), he was geopolitically naive (Panchsheel, UN security council, Sino-Indian war), his political machinations kept some capable men away from power (Patel). In general, he was indecisive and weak. But OTOH, I have to admit that overall he was better than 99% of the other options at that time - his personal stature imbued the PMO with a sense of dignity, he was pretty good as a figurehead - he could speak well and if he had left governance to the officials and confined himself to the ceremonial role, I think he would have been remembered well.\n\n* **Shastri**: [7/10]: Bit of a surprise package. During his early days in office, he'd kept a pretty low profile, almost like late-term MNS. But he rose to the occasion in 1965, when confronted with Pak's Op Grand Slam.  He authorized the military to open a second front - a decisive move that helped India militarily and restored some of the confidence lost in 1962, both among the services and the civilian population\n\n* **Desai**: [1/10]: Fucking disaster. Disgrace to the office of the PM\n\n* **Charan Singh**: N/A: Nonentity but at least not an idiot like Desai\n\n* **Indira Gandhi**: [6/10]: Probably the most divisive of India's PMs. A lot of people overlook that her two terms were very different - her second term was much more low-profile than the 1st one. But overall, she made many mistakes. The emergency of course, but also her nationalization drive (consummating India's flirtation with socialism started by her dad) and her overt political dealings. (FWIW, I don't think her political machinations were any worse than the others', she just carried them out more openly, and broadened her scope of influence, opening the door to other politicians doing the same). She also handled the Khalistan situation badly - Op Blue Star... well, that was a crying shame. On the flip side, she was the most decisive PM India has had - she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job. India's profile rose with the Asian games, CHOGM and other events on her watch. Most importantly, she handled 1971 perfectly - a lot of folks don't understand *how* badly it could have ended for India, given the US position and the localized issues in Bangladesh, Punjab and Pakistan. That the country came out on top is nothing short of incredible\n\n* **Rajiv**: [4/10]: Pretty much a nonentity, wasted years for India.\n\n* **VP Singh**: [2/10]: Mandal and other BS\n\n* **Gujral**: [3/10]: Personal probity aside, his Gujral doctrine was a fucking mess. Still, at least he had some ideas, shitty though they were My top 3 in chornological order - ( Shastri had too short a stint to know for sure) \n\n1- Nehru - Made huge mistakes but setup the way things work in India. We have adjusted some minor things but Indian economy's most important features work the way his team designed- Socialist 5 yr Planning, Non-aligned diplomacy, federal structure where center is all powerful, central institutions of great quality like AIIMS, IIT, IIM \n\nThere is no major change apart from liberalization in 1992 that any PM has done to the precedents laid out by him.\n\n2- PV Narsimha Rao - Gave all of us McDonalds and private sector jobs. Without him liberalizing economy, we would be the at least 20-30% poorer as a nation and individually. \n\n3-  AB Vajpayee - Made major changes to the way India was conducting diplomacy and re-started the process of structural changes PVNR had brought in.  Was Shastri instrumental in anything other than winning the Pak war. Yes, that is a big one, but I have heard people being so impressed with Lal Bahadur Shastri, that I want to know what else did he do? 1. Indira Gandhi (8/10): Split Pakistan into two pieces...this victory is the greatest Indian victory since the Marathas defeated the Mughals. Also, she convinced the Sikhs that an independent country in northwestern India will not even be discussed.  Can you imagine how horrible it would be to have a country that plays Pak and India against each other and shelters agents from both sides?\n\n2. Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekar, IK Gujral, HD Deve Gowda (7/10). These prime ministers proved that India was not a Single-Party state. They provided the first viable opposition to Congress and showed that whoever wins an election in India will peacefully take power. Also, these Janata Dal governments were among the first to have leaders from Middle-Caste and Lower-Middle Castes...this integrated these communities into democratic India by assuring them that India belonged to them too. Deve Gowda is especially important because he assured non-Brahmin dravidians that India would not treat them like 2nd Class citizens. \n\n3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (6.99/10) for improving the budged deficit, undertaking infrastructure projects and for establishing a permanent and resilient opposition party. \n\n4. PV Narasimha Rao (6.98/10) for liberalizing the economy. Also he was the first non-Nehru dynasty person to serve a 5 year term. This is why his memory is erased in the Congress party...they don't want to acknowledge that the Congress can thrive without the Family. \n\n5. Manmohan Singh (4/10). For making India enter into some nice nuclear deals. Also, though he was largely a figurehead, at least he made sure an Italian didn't become PM. It would have been might embarrassing for a country known for anti-imperialism to be ruled voluntarily by a European. I know Sonia largely (but not completely) ran the show behind the scenes but still symbolism is important and I'm glad Manmohan was the PM representing India overseas. \n\n6. The rest were not really consequential positive or negative. \n\n\n\n Nehru: 8/10. Passed the Hindu bills in spite of opposition from almost all pro Hindu organizations. If not for him Hindus today would have been in same state as Muslims. His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten helped India a lot in partition. Sure he erred on Kashmir but Kashmir anyway could have gone either ways. He is the reason we have democracy. While almost every post colonial democracy failed, India thrived because of him. He actually believed in democracy. Had he died 5-10 years earlier, India would surely have lapsed into dictatorship. His economic philosophies were alright for his times but were carried on for long because of his family being in power. \n\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee: 7/10. Mistake on Kargil but India coped well. Went big on infrastructure, the best thing to happen. Very few scams during his time compared to any other PM.\n\nNarsimha Rao: 6/10 Started liberalization and helped India break from stagnation.\n\nShastri: 5/10 Led India well, clean image. Had promise.\n\nIndira Gandhi: 4/10 Emergency and some extreme socialist decision notwithstanding she did well in operation Bluestar and 71 war.\n\nRajiv Gandhi/Manmohan Singh: -5/10 Took India years back.\n\nEveryone else: 0 they were just holding onto their chair. Confession: I don't know much about PMs before Rajeev, other than Indira. Hence, my rankings:\n\n\n1. AB Vajpayee (1999-2004) - True globalization. Stable economy, low inflation. Honorable foreign policy, good handling of Kargil. \n\n2. PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) - Good handling of BoP crisis. Tried to make a break from Gandhi Dynasty.\n\nThe rest are worthy of contempt:\n\nNegative 1,000,000 - Indira Gandhi (1966-1984) - Started India's love affair with all that's evil today, from sloth and corruption to ineptitude and greed. India's Hitler and Castro rolled into one. May she rot in hell.\n\nNegative 1000 - Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989) - Perpetuated Momma's stupidities, fine tuned vote bank politics, first PM level corruption.\n\nNegative 500 - Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-) - Took India from \"growing economy\" to \"stagnated economy\" and now disaster story\n\nNegative 500 - VP Singh (1989-1990) - Mandal Commission, indecisive on key policy points\n\nThe rest (post Rajeev) are idiots. 1. Narasimha Rao\n2. Vajpayee \n\n\n3. Manmohan Singh (UPA 1 only)\n4. Lal Bahadur shastri (just for winning the war)\n gujral missing in the list?! Shastri - Best Ever\nIndira Gandhi - Strong leader..though misuse of power but stability\nAB VP - Nuff Said\nNehru - Guided through nascent democracy years\nPV N - Filled the void in bringing open markets\nVP - Alternative\nRG - Unable to use absolute majority to guide india and set up as a success\nMMS - Do I even type\nMoraji Desai - Opened can of worms of bad governments\nCharan Singh - Why was he PM\nNanda - Filler...served his purpose\nDeve Gowda - Classic example of what is wrong with Indian electoral system\nChandra Shekar - If there is a way to make this unhappen, please look into it. Modi\r\rAll others I don't know PMs before ABVP, so my order is short:\n\n1. Vajpayee\n2. Manmohan Singh\n\nBut if I'll have to go by what I've read and heard:\n\nVajpayee\n\nNehru*\n\nNarasimha Rao\n\nIndira Gandhi*\n\n* excluding their blunders, which seems to almost nullify and makes them a bad one.\n\nOnes I dislike:\n\nManmohan Singh\n\nRajiv Gandhi\n\nIndira Gandhi\n\nNehru\n\nYep, they make both of my lists.",

    "comment" : " Good work..But you have defended Chidambaram / Congress quiet well there and have solely blamed it on booming US economy / BRICS just like UPA apologists like Mihir Sharma does..Investors are not moving to other countries just because US economy is picking up , they are moving because starting a business with this fucked up govt is a braindrain.\n\nAlso read this http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/columnists/swaminathan-s-a-aiyar/why-the-rupee-can-keep-falling/articleshow/22199452.cms\n\n Watch [Truth Vs Hype on Food Security Bill](http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/truth-vs-hype/truth-vs-hype-who-s-afraid-of-the-food-security-bill/288918) with as much less Congress hate as possible.\n\nIMO, FSB is a good bill, passed at the wrong time. OP, you have spent your time writing stuff up - educating people and sharing something you believe in and that itself is commendable. \n\nMost people don't even know the basics of economy - so this post could be a good starting point for further discussions. I saw somebody calling you out as a socialist - and that shows how under-educated even our elite is(assuming those on /r/india are elites). You could perhaps expand more on why our government decided to spend a large amount of cash on welfare policies and compare the same with few first world nations. \n\nPersonally, I believe govt should just focus on governing and the rest should be left to the economy. They do a bad job at everything they touch so policies like National Corruption Guarantee Scheme are bound to fail in India. But even while I say that, the policies themselves are not that bad. Guaranteed employment, food, education etc are all very good and noble ideas. Hopefully, someday we will have a stronger economy to implement these ideas well.  Does it mean that if a lot of people stop using cars value of Rupee may go up?\n\nAlso good work OP. I think it's a combination of both the export/import gap as explained, but also the result of economic slowdown in India and continued questions about India's fiscal responsibilities.\n\n Commenting to come back and read later. It has been a fantastic read so far  OP is telling facts !! He must be dynastly-loving *sickular* !!\n\nLe reddit India army, attack !!\n\n\nPS: Great work ! Guys, I know it's long but pls give it a shot.  ALL WRONG! HOW DARE U NOT BLAME DA SICKULARS FOR DIS!!!!!!!! Bhaii it's really long so will probably save it for tomorrow, gonna read it on boss's time not on a Sunday..\n\nBut honestly, I tip my hat for the effort and all.. \n\nCheers..",

I hope they do well. Thing I am afraid is that it might split the opposition vote and give Congress another win. One more term for Congress and I think we are doomed. Should give them one chance. Things couldn't be worse anyway Sooner or later he will have to open his mouth to voice his opinions on issues other than corruption and quite frankly he is a simpleton.\n\nLets hope he focuses completely on the corruption agenda, gets enough votes to be, at the very least, a strong enough voice as part of a coalition with any of the two parties and force them into implementing greater transparency measures and strong anti corruption laws. Where is the party? Will they serve drinks? Nothing is going to happen. For a party to be successful funds are needed. No one's going to back up Anna. We suffer from a lack of options in politics so I welcome any serious attempt to break the two party system. Unfortunately this party will probably be very extreme in most things. ref: AH saying alcoholics should be hanged and ambivalence on separatist issues. This is silly. Now they will just split the anti-incumbency vote, which would have gone to the BJP, and let Congress win again. They have no source of funding and no agenda. Heck, they dont even have unity within their own group!! Only Kejriwal and his coterie may think contesting elections is a good idea. You cant win elections like this. They'd have done better if they had remained an NGO and campaigned against corrupt candidates by making the public more aware of who the right candidate is. Now the whole anti-corruption thing is going to fizzle out. I would really like to see them do well, but \"Power Corrupts\". Also, some of his comments on personal freedoms are disturbing. They're likely to merge with the NDA. I can see this turning into a grand failure. Anna knows zilch about running a country and Swami Ramdev is only advocating the Hindutva brand of politics. \n\nThe Indian economy will be in a deeeep slump if these clowns actually come to power.  how does he plan to get enough candidates to make a impact ?\n\nFrom facebook ??

His statement was lost amid the domestic din following his controversial decision to pull high-value banknotes out of circulation.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping made a similar point on the sidelines of a conference in Peru. He pledged to further open up the Chinese economy so that the benefits of economic integration were shared more widely. These parallel statements by the leaders of the two largest emerging economies come at a time when protectionist sentiment is gradually casting a long shadow in the developed world, especially after the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. Global trade by value has also been shrinking.\n\nThe backlash against globalization in several rich countries is because a growing numbers of voters there believe that free trade has harmed them, as jobs have moved to Asia. A robust debate is still under way among economists whether technology has been a bigger reason why median incomes have stagnated in these countries, but the dominant narrative blames free trade.\n\nThe situation in India and China is quite different. Millions have been pulled out of poverty because of the opportunities offered by globalization. Economist Branko Milanović has provided one of the most evocative visuals of what he has described as the greatest reshuffle in global incomes in the past three centuries. His elephant diagram shows that the two groups that have seen the most rapid rise in incomes in the two decades after 1988 are the few in the top income percentile (the global elite) and the hundreds of millions around the median income (mainly people from India and China).\n\nThis fact partly explains why leaders such as Modi and Xi are committing themselves to open economies even while Western countries that originally pushed for globalization are getting attracted to protectionism. Their middle class has been one of the undisputed beneficiaries of globalization, and hence has a strong interest in more economic integration with the rest of the world.\n\nBut what precisely does being the most open economy in the world entail? Modi did not provide any details. Trade policy has definitely become less restrictive since the advent of economic reforms: import tariffs that were once among the highest in the world have come down dramatically. The goal set by the initial reformers that average tariff levels should come down to East Asian levels has been met. There is no doubt that the old protectionist walls have been dismantled.\n\nThe trade-policy reforms over the past 25 years have also resulted in better trade outcomes. The trade/gross domestic product ratio has doubled. India, however, can never reach the levels of openness of a country such as Singapore because of its size. Smaller countries tend to have a higher trade ratio because their domestic markets aren’t big enough.\n\nThe record is less encouraging when it comes to trade in services, despite the success of the software services industry. Trade in services usually increases in tandem with prosperity, so India still has some distance to go. The other two indicators of openness are restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital account controls. India has far fewer FDI restrictions, though some sectoral caps persist, but the experience of China shows that there is an umbilical link between higher FDI and more international trade.\n\nIndia has also brought down most of its barriers to capital inflows, though there are still controls. The standard measure for capital account openness—the Chinn-Ito index—shows that India has far more controls on capital flows compared to its peers. The traditional view within the economic policy establishment has been that capital-account convertibility should be a gradual process, and deeply dependent on durable macroeconomic stability as well as a strong banking system. The Modi government has as yet shown no sign that it has broken with this convention.\n\nIndia is definitely a far more open economy than it was before the economic reforms of 1991. Millions of Indians have benefitted from its integration with the global economy, though that has increased the income gap between those who could take advantage of globalization and those who could not. India and China should be important voices in the protection of the liberal international order—both through a more active role in global institutions and through domestic reform that advances the cause of global economic integration.\n\nShould India and China stand up for globalization when its advocates are dwindling across the developed world?

This bespeaks of total ignorance of the dire state of the colonial economy of India, aggravated by Partition; nor was the post-World War II world economy any better. Some Nehru-baiters have described his economic policy as “Stalinist”. This is stupid. The “socialistic pattern of society”, adopted at the AICC session at Avadi in January 1955, which I covered, was not Soviet communism.\nState control of the “commanding heights of the economy” that Nehru believed in was also the policy of most west European governments then. What went wrong here was that it lasted too long. Even in Nehru’s time the system had become what C. Rajago­p­alachari, better known as Rajaji, rightly described as “licence-permit-quota raj” that inevitably bred corruption. This system should have been ended preferably by 1970. Sadly, Indira Gandhi stretched it too long primarily for political, not economic, reasons, as I.G. Patel, economic affairs secretary at that time, has recorded in the case of bank nationalisation.\" Wow it got downvoted in less than 1 minute after submission.

    "comment" : " Because unlike the occupy hipsters in the West, we've lived through welfare socialism and have seen the effects of economic liberalization.\n\n I'm socially on the left wing, but right wing when it comes to economics. I'm totally for a free market economy. I wish India would adopt the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model).  >Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?\n\nSorry but your understanding of economics seems to be flawed. India is a mixed economy - State and Private sector are involved in production and it is not a free market economy, but a heavily regulated economy in which the state intervenes to correct the natural equilibrium of demand & supply.\n\nThe model you are referring to is the Nordic model (Social Market Economy to use the technical term). In this the type of set up there is actually more free market than the crony free market of the US or other \"free market\" economies.\n\nA Nordic model is one that is capitalistic but tempered by an implementation of Ordoliberalism which says markets are free, competition decides if companies thrive or fall BUT there will be regulation to ensure fair competition.\n\n>why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?\n\nWho wants to move to a free market corpotocracy? What (and I generalise) a lot of young Indians want is labour law reforms, more transparent rule making while reducing discretionary nonsense that is the cornerstone of Indian bureaucracy right now, support for infrastructure and consequently letting the private sector do what it does best. Make money, create goods & services while creating jobs. Nobody says that we shouldn't invest tax money in poverty alleiviation programs or investing in infrastructure or run schools & hospitals or any such thing! What we want is an end to the Maai-Baap sarkaari model that the CONgress has imposed upon this nation for 50 years. A model in which the government uses hand-outs to control votes, while keeping the nation poor and dependant on the government for their daily bread & butter.\n\n>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.\n\nThis is the second time I am seeing your admiration for FDR and not questioning that, but what do you understand of his policies?\n\nHave you truly looked at Modi's economic philosophies? Till Kujliwala said crony capitalism, nobody ever accused Modi / Guj of crony capitalism. \n\nAnyways, back to the topic on hand,\n\nFDR's key solutions to recovery were as follows,\n\n* Recovery of the Agriculture sector\n* Create jobs at stable wages (in reality though, wages dipped while the number of jobs created increased-check wages paid out via the WPA if you need clarity on this)\n* Using a fiscal deficit (atleast in the 1st & 2nd New Deals) to fund the WPA to create infrastructure.\n* Increased corporate taxation (it is another matter that this was absolutely watered down)\n\nThere are other Fiscal policies / Monetary policies which I will not discuss now as it is not relevant to the point I am trying to make below.\n\nLook at Modi's Gujarat minus whatever blinkers you might have.\n\n* The only state to have grown it's Primary (agriculture) sector at 10% plus, while the rest of the country grew at roughly 2%. While critics point out to other \"advanced states\" like Maha or TN and compare GDP growth rates, keep in mind the growth patterns of these states is NOT SUSTAINABLE. They have moved directly from a primary economy to a tertiary economy skipping entirely the manufacturing phase which is where jobs are created.\n\n* As a net share - Manufacturing+Agriculture contribute roughly 60% of the states GDP, while in states like Maha and TN this would be at a paltry 35%. Keep in mind, nationally Agri+Manufacturing account for close to 70% of all employment.\n\n* State with the LOWEST unemployment figures - The above thrust on the primary & secondary are paying off. Jobs are being created. Have real wages dipped? yes, but that is more of a function of demand & supply equilibirum and less of \"Evil Adani pays less hurr durr\". \n\n* Taxation in Guj (despite all accusations of crony capitalism aside) has increased, it has the highest contribution of tax revenue as a percentage of total revenue is at 80% which is the highest in the country! Clearly, all that free land is paying off in the form of increased state taxes.\n\nHow does any of the above equate to crony capitalism? Why would a crony capitalist develop the primary sectory where 60% of our population works? If anything, thrust on the agricultural sector+increased job creation+increased taxation were aside from the fiscal tweakings a corner stone of FDR's New Deal.\n\nTruly you seem to be spouting the same gibberish less informed people spout, you might want to look at the macro economic indicators before you come to any conclusions.\n\nNot every Chaddi wearing Sanghi is a brain dead communalist, some of us have decided to vote for him more because of his economic policies and not for whatever else people vote for him.\n\n>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?\n\nReally? Simply take a list of the big name MNC's and Indian manufacturing powerhouses operating out of Guj and Adani / Ambani would be just one amongst the Fords, Samsungs, Peugeots, Renaults, Lakshmi Steels, Mahindra's, Tata's etc etc. It is sad that off all the bad things Kujliwala has done, he has used his goodwill in convincing people that Modi's gujarat supports crony capitalism! Not much original thought in this. Essentially your entire question = \"they are doing, why aren't we?\"\n\n>Outside of sources like Fox news, western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8. The same general idea is reflected in the educated youth/college grads in the developed world too.\n\nNeither the media, nor the students, are contributing to their nations' growth.\n\n>Why does India have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ?\n\nBecause it's required. The kids joining International Socialist Organization live in first world countries that can afford unemployment benefits.\n\n>Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?\n\nBecause we have the largest number of extremely poor people. We need to make money to feed them.\n\n>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.\n\nRonald Reagan was one man's comparison. In any case, all American presidents have sworn by free enterprise, it's only their socialism that has varied in degrees. Modi is pro-welfare too, just not a welfare state to the exclusion or detriment of private enterprise.\n\n>Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.\n\nSelfish is a good thing. We want to make money. We want to pay taxes. We want the poor to be helped, but don't hold us back from our own destinies.\n\n>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?\nPersonally I doubt there will be any major change in economic or foreign policy no matter who comes to power, but the mentality of India's urban educated youth is interesting.\n\nMeh. Your p.o.v is too popular and stopped being relevant after the BOP crisis.\n\n**India has no option. If not Modi, then someone from the economic right.** I believe it is mostly due to a false sense of entitlement and upbringing, The fact that you have had a decent life and have never had to live through abject poverty leads to apathy towards the underprivileged. So you tend to root for policies that will benefit your current standing, which in case of educated young Indians are the right wing policies. Because America and the west have strayed in too much to the right. We have strayed on too much to the left. You're comparing two different things. On the political scale, I am a left-social libertarian. Economically, I am liberal but to an extent. I believe in laissez-faire capitalism but with government oversight and regulation to prevent monopolies, pollution, and gouging customers. Essentially, rules that would apply to an individual to ensure the harmonious functioning of society, should apply to a corporation as well.\n\nNow if the economic climate is way to the right of me, I would look like I am on the left of the spectrum. In an economic climate that is way to the left of me, I would look like I am on the right of the spectrum.\n\nThe first case applies to the US. I have been here since '99. I think the economic policies are pretty much brain-dead and have gone too far to the right. Intense deregulation is what led to the financial crisis of '08. Corporations have way too much power, and you essentially have state-sanctioned monopoly ensured by the revolving door between corporations and Washington (current head of FCC used to work for Comcast for example). \n\nIn India, you have the other extreme. Far-left policies and the disastrous experimentation with Fabian socialism have stunted the economy and slowed down development. The Indian economy is comparatively hostile to entrepreneurship, although the situation is way better than it was, say 20 years ago. In fact, it was a combination of Nehru's and Indira's policies that brought India to the brink of bankruptcy in '89/'90, and it was only because of liberalization at that point that India's economy was saved. The additional liberalization during the NDA years also helped.\n\nSo this, in short, is why I favor regulation in the US, but deregulation in India. What India needs to do is learn from the mistakes the US made and not go too far in that direction. Because India is too far to the left economically relative to the US. You can't equate the current right wing of US with anything. According to their principles even their past governments would have been considered liberal. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag.

When he came to Delhi School of Economics a couple of years ago to deliver a lecture, we all saw his oratory and knowledge. Great to see him as RBI chief. We can hope something good from this guy. He is just brilliant.  Why do we have to have some 'outsider' head RBI, why can't one of the deputy governors be promoted? An outsider is not the thing we need at this moment. This is the first time the finance minister of India is also the RBI Governor. Don't doubt RR's abilities but he is Chidu's shadow in this role. ",

Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  \n>  \n>*\"The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.\"*\n\nProud of her, she deserves it ❤️ Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.\n  \nThis is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory\n\nEdit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark \n\nhttps://www.hotstar.com/sports/badminton/final-okuhara-vs-sindhu/1440001984 Also B. Sai Praneeth won the Bronze medal in Men's singles category. Two medals in a single tournament. Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat*",

He showed a lot of promise. It’s an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.\nLet’s see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! \n\nAll aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow.",

Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it’s sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it’s due.

Olympics medal tally is directly proportional to per capita income and population size. Why do we care so much about the Olympics? What about the world championships of the resepective sports.",

RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.\n\nThe core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.\n\nWe need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. \n\nAllowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense.",

    "comment" : " Since you compare with China, I will paste my comment from an earlier thread\n\n> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.\n\nIndia needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. \n\nIt comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. \n\nIndians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, \"host country effect\" and \"Olympics-oriented investment\" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.\n\nWould you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don’t give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.\n\n1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. \n\n2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.\n\n3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.\n\n4. Olympics: Consider the types of competitions in Olympics. I would understand if there was 1 swimming event. Instead there are dozens of different combinations of swimming related events. This excludes most poor countries where swimming pools are a luxury. Equestrian events - need I explain?",

Game of Thrones, meanwhile, is at 9.2Mbps, which is almost twice as heavy in terms of bitrate than other HBO titles. Even Chernobyl, a lot of which happens in the dark, has a bitrate of 5.7Mbps.\n\nNow, 4–6Mbps isn't necessarily a bad 1080p bitrate, especially if you are a service like Netflix that knows exactly how to encode video with that kind of a limitation.\n\nBut Hotstar is no Netflix, and their encoding is not very good. \n\n2\\. *Content is censored and/or mutilated*\n\nIron Man 2 is censored (and I'm not just talking about the bleeps in the Senate hearing). Like, Star World on TV level censored. Oh, and it suffers from the low-ass bitrate too. \n\n3\\. *Omnipresent logo on top right*\n\nWhy the hell does Hotstar think it is important enough to interrupt my viewing experience with their intrusive-ass logo? What does this achieve? Their DRM is already super-annoyingly world-class (probably thanks to third party firms paid off by HBO and the like). \n\nAnd if you watch a livestream, like GoT or IPL, you are forced to see both this logo as well as the Hotstar icon on the bottom right. \n\n4\\. *Not accessible*\n\nNot a single one of Hotstar's titles has closed captioning. Fuck deaf people. Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has an audio description track, even if one exists for the title (eg. Hollywood/HBO). To be fair, this shortcoming applies to every Indian streaming service. Which makes no sense, since we have the second population of people with sensory impairments. \n\n5\\. *DRM-ed to the balls*\n\nNew device? Sorry, you're requesting multiple streams at the same time. Android phone? Sorry, we cannot show you 1080p video. VPN? Don't even go there. \n\n6\\. *All of this was preventable*\n\nVideo quality? Just have more versions of titles at a higher bitrate for people with good internet. Logo? It's not burned into the video, so just take it off. Inaccessible? Just ask rightsholders to also send subtitle files and audio description files. Make DRM just as unintrusive as other streaming services that do business with the exact same group of companies you do. Censoring? Don't fucking do it. As simple as that.

Then you have to play the episode, select subtitles and then again fast forward the opening credits. Downloaded episodes on phone expire in a day. Shitty user interface. Netflix cost 600/month. Hotstar has PL for 999/year. \n\nCheap> Quality. Especially for people like me who has hardly any time to watch anything. And you forgot about the search engine of hotstar. It's literally terrible. Also no 5.1 surround sound support. Yes but for ₹999/year I won’t complain I am yet to create an account and subscribe myself onto any of the streaming services and thus, I don't have an idea about the quality and content of each streaming services but, we won't be having Disney + here right?\n\nAs in most (if not all) those Disney + shows will be hosted by Hotstar here in India? Also, Hotstar is the one that has the entire MCU library, if I'm not mistaken? For 999/year includes IPL and English Premier League. It is a STEAL for sports fans..

Do you ask that to a cricketer? Sportspersons should be encouraged by giving sponsors so they concentrate on game&not financial burden. All the sports in India other than cricket deal with this because neither they are televised nor they are reported enough. Sponsorship depends upon popularity of sport which is very rare for weightlifting. You know every player's name of a cricket team but not the same with archery or any other sport. And to be real Sports Authority of India suck's the biggest! Well the sports authorities are busy attending the cricket World Cup so rest all sorts can wait. When participating in international events, is it possible to represent a neutral faction/body, instead of your own country? Because if the country doesn't care or appreciate efforts towards it, then sportspersons are better off representing something else. If it's not cricket then India doesn't care, it's sad but true. For a nation of over 1 billion people we should, purely statistically speaking, have way way more Olympians and medals.

More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  \n\nNike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. \n\nFor context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) \n\nFuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. \n\nThe store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. \n\nThese Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices.

Sadly Hasan Took the easy way out and decried it as racism. Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. \n\nBut when others do it it's curruption...\n\nBCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.\n\nI am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!\n\nPs. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said \"It would have been great had our players came back earlier\" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. Does anyone else find him annoying? Ah yeah let me comment on others house made of glass while I sit in my comfort zone inside a well built fenced house.\nI will only identify myself as an Indian while playing the victim card. \nJust sayin. I stopped watching IPL a few years ago as it became too many matches for me to care. Glad I did. Even FIFA is more interesting with all their scandals as it happens once every few years instead of every year! Is it bad that I feel proud when he says \"BCCI made ICC it's bitch.\" If BCCI is bringing in this amount of Insane money where is it actually going? I am the only one who is seeing the symbolism in his hoodie choice for the episode.",

    "comment" : " The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.\n\nSecond reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.\n\nIf we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.\n\nI listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. \n\nHere's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.\n\nThat being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO \"pros\" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.\n\nAlso to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the \"society\" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy \"addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned\". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.\n\nBut I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )\n\nEsports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.\n\nIn the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.\n\nRecently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.\n\nWe might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport.",

    "comment" : " TLDR - No. \n\nReal answer - ICC isn’t really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it’ll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ’d in it 🤦‍♂️ I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become \"more South Asian\" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don’t bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.\n\nAnd i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)",

For example the purchase of an airgun requires you to be first a member of a shooting club, these clubs don't entertain applications unless you know someone or bribe them to give you membership, these people are fucking corrupt as hell and will treat you like a piece of shit unless you are well connected.  Purchase of a fire arm is next to impossible for the common man. They will never give you a firearm license if you say you want it for sport. Majority of the indian shooters come from law-enforcement and military community. \n\nThis sport is for the upper elite, there is no grassroot sport shooting revolution, may be there are more rich shooters now. I think the Olympic gold did capture public attention. Coupled with India hosting Commonwealth games just after it, and doing well there, there has been more attention to Olympic sports. Of course, the attention isn't very detailed and sports ministry still lacks significant accountability mechanisms, but I feel there is more interest in Olympic sport athletes.

Suspended.\n\nAnother mechanical professor (also hostel warden) tortured hostel students, he shit his pants when one student drank all-out mosquito repellant. He liked students who are scared easily and act like slaves. He had some kind of joy feeling powerful over these helpless kids who came to unknown city and stayed in that hostel.\n\nMy school math teacher was a hardcore christian, she gave special care to christian students. A non-christian student not scoring is dumb, but a christian student not scoring needed practice. \n\nTuition teacher prefers talkative and jovial ones, he was a strict math teacher in KV but jovial and friendly guy in his tuition classes. He even teaches shortcuts and easy methods in tuition but not in school.\n\nPT teacher was hell bent on sports and never let other teachers take PT period as substitute for their subjects. We all loved her. She liked the ones who got her medals in zonals.\n\nMy computer teacher liked the ones who are smart and answers questions first..Imagine students like Hermione from harry potter. \n\nBiology teacher was the best who genuinely worried about underperforming students. Never gave special attention to top students as they never needed it in first place\n\n\nTo answer your question, i think this is all subjective. i think it all comes down to have a student behaves with a teacher cuz even they are human and then comes all the other factors like academic performance etx [deleted] Kids who interact in class - not the ones who stare into the abyss like brain-dead zombies. Kids who question, challenge and provide alternative to what I teach. Kids who are cool and talk wittily - not the \"yes, sir\" kind of flattering dorks. I like if they are involved in extra-curricular activities, but it should not be at the cost of their primary goal - education.\n\nP.S.: I am an Assistant Professor (Engineering) in a top government college. I teach online and one on one which makes for a very different experience than classroom teaching - the most inspiring ones are those who never give up. They may be less gifted, and scores may disappoint. But they tenaciously keep working and in the end their results have always surprised me.\n\nJust last year one student who i taught over two years and despaired for his performance made it through to NIT Surathkal.\n\nAnother guy who I briefly taught in 10th, was pretty ordinary, but made up for that with insane amounts of work and got into IIT-B. There he stepped it up sleeping only 4 hours a day on occasion and won the Presidents Gold Medal. When he graduated, Stanford and MIT rolled out red carpets to welcome him to their campus.\n\nI could go on, but these two really stood out. Not a full time teacher; help a few kids in my neighborhood with their studies. I try to get them to stay inquisitive, ask questions & accept it is alright to say \"I don't know\". School education discourages then from asking questions (especially if it falls outside their syllabus). [removed] Toppers Dead I like the ones who are curious about things.\n\nDoesn't matter which subject music/sport/science/business/cooking/art whatever. They go and try to find the answers and come back with many questions. Watching that process, of them discovering things for the first time by their own effort is very inspiring and satisfying. IANAT but other half is. \n\nRecently she was most impressed by a student who was deported from another school after failing, came here, continued to do poorly upto preparatory exams but got things together, concentrated and worked hard and ended up in high sixties (%). Approaching the exams she used to say I will be most happy if this kid passes. And was ecstatic to see his scores finally. There were many kids in 90+ and 80+ range in the same batch. \n\nTroublemakers are remembered but for wrong reasons.",

Just like you can demarcate India's economy with pre & post liberalization, you can actually demarcate Indian cricket pre & post Dhoni. Pre MSD, we were a good team that might win it all one day. We had couples of fairytale matches, the NatWest final, comes to mind that would cherish for ages, and we had some of world's best players. But we didn't use to win as much. We learned how to reach the finals, but we lacked the how to win it. \n\nPost MS, we became favourites in most tournaments we enter. Again, we don't win everything that's in front of us like those big bad Aussies but every time we don't, it feels like one off day. Not an structural problem. We might be having more of these now. But MS came, he changed us, and delivered a World Cup. Before than he delivered a T20 cup, and after as an encore delivered a Champions Trophy. He also won us the mace of the best test team. We just started winning more. We were not scared of losing the match in first five over anymore. We had our finisher. Now, it was the time for them to be scared of us.\n\nIt's a testament to his resolve that a boy with not-so-great technique reached here, and it's a celebration of India's cricket that a boy from Ranchi could reach here. No longer is Indian cricket in those urban metro pockets. No longer a kid in Mumbai is sure to be in the team more than that kid from some tier 2 / tier 3 town whose father is working in small public sector job. Now, they compete for same prize. I hope India gets a transformational player from North East too, and truly make Indian cricket \"Indian\" cricket.\n\nMSD truly changed us. If you don't see, just look at all the other Asian team around us, they win because of their individual brilliance, but they not outperform their ceiling. We were once like them. Then we started being not like them. We became a unit that wins. And, there's no one to thank more than MSD for that. \n\nThank you, skip, the pleasure was all ours. Farewell. If I want to learn one thing from you, it's the ability to take both wins & losses, both good & bad, in the same way, in the same stride. For both are just impostors in this battle called life anyway.",

    "comment" : " I don't think anyone rates him for his  personality, He is a brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream Punjabi/Delhi attitude.  If it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork, he would've been another Sreensanth. When did this become Unpopular? It’s a free country. He is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him. Why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever? I have gone from being a hater to absolutely adoring him (no homo). \n\nHe earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency, performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him. Kohli is probably not as gifted as Sachin BUT he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease. \n\nHe plays cricket for India and is bloody good at it, that's all that matters. If you want to hear his side of the story then watch Nat Geo Masterclass episode on him.\n\nEdit: No doubt he's bit of an asshole. He's a sports person and every sports person has their own style. You can see that in different sports as well. See Ronaldo, Djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them. So what's wrong? \nHe's not the most talented cricketer like Rohit Sharma, but he's the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and  determination and dedication to fitness.\n( I met Virat once off the field, he's a really kind person and gentleman. ) I don't care about his personality. He's a great player. Rohit sharma is a gifted and telented batsman.However , Virat kohli is Hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents. If you see earlier records(under nineteenth even couple of years after) compare Rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him.However Virat kohli is diciplined ,hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last 4 years(heard in an interview) compare love handles of rohit sharma.Nothing against rohit sharma, Scoring 264 in an international is nothing sort of a miracle. But virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices ,He is impatience but compensate with perseverance. He is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects.Whenever he is on Buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book.I am not fan of virat kohli but i am fan of his dicipline and regime. Aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports. Cricket in particular. \n\nSome manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics, some do it in body language, and some really talented ones do both. Whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field?\n\nJust because Dhoni was cool, not everyone can be like him\n\nIf you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension I don't understand the folks here. First you guys cry about the 'Log Kya kahenge' attitude of parents. And when someone doesn't give a damn about it, you turn back and say ' Hooo, you're a role-model, act like it'. Why TF should he care what people & kids think about him?",

The comment section is enlightening.\n\n\"Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.\"\n\n\"Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)\nDoom is near when we forget ours roots.\"\n***\nThis is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.\nAs for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.\nIt's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. \nI'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about \"unnaturality\" and the fact that \"it won't support procreation\".\nSir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.\n\nBecause, soon she would need that help.",

Paid around 600 for a lot of channels. Now I only have like 15 paid channels along with free channels and paying 260 for it. I wish some sense prevails and TRAI brings back revised older tariff as even the pack with all my favorite channels set me back only around 400 and for the same now, I need to pay for 700!! WTF! They must limit the rate of broadcaster bouquet packs. e.g. the rate of HBO HD is 12Rs. While the Turner HD+ pack of HBO, Disney, WB is 12.50 Rs. So why would anyone choose just a single channel if they can get more channel at the same rate or slightly more? There must be a rule that the rate of a bouquet must not less than, say 70% of total of rates of channels. Then only broadcasters will be forced to keep the price per channel low. Tariffs need to go higher not lower, or get ready for longer ad breaks, ads even taking up screen space during regular programming, and even more substandard content. TRAI needs to stop interfering in pricing.",

They were not able to reduce the call drops. They totally screwed us during net neutrality until (due to immense public pressure) they decided to go with it. And now this. Its time TRAI is held accountable for its existence.  TRAI anticipates that channel prices will come down gradually.\n\nBut I'd say get a firestick , a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps. I switched and never lookd back to DTH.  I am an Indian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels (kannada, tamil, telugu, hindi, english) and I have to pay almost around 800 ish if I want to have the same experience. So fuck me right TRAI. Real dick move by TRAI This pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with. TRAI had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets. 15% max discount on bouquet than a-la-carte. That would have gotten the price of individual channels down. All operators went to Madras High Court against this rule where HC ruled against TRAI. With much lower prices for bouquets than a-la-carte, operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way. [As of now, TRAI has withdrawn 15% discount cap petition from Supreme Court] Same here.\n\nMy yearly subscription will end soon. I have already subscribed to Sony Liv and Zee5. Will subscribe to Hotstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available (they don't have subscription model as of today). It will cost me around INR 3000  per year. I have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized. So I'll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since I have multiple TV, the average will be much less. I thank TRAI for screwing up this well. I think I was way too comfortable with what I had. They made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization. Removed sony channels. Got Sony liv yearly subscription.   I used to pay 280 for all the channels, now I have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch. Go to hell TRAI.  Mine went from 280 to 200 [deleted]",

I agree, idk wtf happened to rcb.  Like everything in life. Bro I stopped watching cricket after 12 std. Got too bored. You have grown older, now you shoulder more responsibilities. IPL has started already? I'm not kidding. I seriously wasn't aware.  Yep. I miss the olden days of cricket. It's hard to stay interested if a month-and-half(?) long event that happens every year. The players keep hopping teams. BCCI adds and removes teams as it pleases. Nothing about the format inspires loyalty towards any team. The whole tournament is designed to squeeze out maximum number of matches.\n\nBut in general I stopped caring about cricket a while ago so that's definitely the biggest reason.

Honda CB shine SP, Bajaj Discover 150F, Bajaj Pulsar 135 LS, Bajaj Discover 125, Hero Glamour, Hero MotoCorp Achiever, TVS Star City Plus, TVS Sport, Bajaj Platina, Hero splendour plus, Hero splendour ismart 110, Hero passion Pro i3s, Honda Livo.\n\nI've listed some 100 CC bikes too coz 100cc bikes are the ones which give best mileage.\n\nPlatina, TVS Star City, TVS Sport, Passion Pro Splendour ismart or Splendour plus give 80+ mileage in the bikes I've listed above. Bajaj platina is rated at 90kmpl so probably 80kmpl real world. I'd rather go for a scooter and sacrifice some mileage cause as per my experience cheap bikes arnt that great to ride.\n\nEdit: for long rides don't even think of a 100cc bike. I'd say Apache RTR 160 and up is only suitable and nothing below. TVS Radeon Either wait for an electric bike or buy a second hand bike for less. Motorbikes in your budget (100-125cc): TVS Star City, Hero Honda Slendor, Bajaj Platina, etc.  \nScooter in your budget (100-125cc): Honda Activa, TVS Jupiter, etc.   \n  \nKeep in mind the on-road price adds registration + lifetime road tax + insurance premium + dealer handling charges*. IRDAI changes in Sep 2018 mandates purchase of new 2 wheelers to include a 5 year insurance policy for third party. It's a multi-year policy but added to your on-road cost. I think prices went up ~ Rs 3.2k for bikes upto 150cc.\n  \nMotorbikes in your budget range which will not be convenient for those occasional long distance travels. Either increase your budget to around 1L for 150-160cc bikes or consider a utility scooter given that you will be driving in Bangalore traffic. I'd pick an Activa for utility instead of Bajaj Platini bike. Ofcourse it's purely a personal preference. Honda Unicorn Look into a preowned unicorn or activa. Search on olx/quikr et al to get an idea of the price. Try and get a 2-3 year old slightly used model. Should set you around 40k all in. Please do invest in a good helmet. Mileage from the activa should hover around 40ish in real city conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet an activa as the others are mentioning as it is the best mode of travel in the city.

I am a a liberal and can't stand the divide that Modi's propaganda has created in Indian society. But an opposition of right wing ideology doesn't mean that you end up supporting INC and its policies, which are not completely liberal either.\n\nTheir are certain well known (blue tick) handles on Twitter, who have a liberal viewpoint. Few live abroad. I normally agree with their viewpoints, but much to my dismay, some of them seem to support INC, and are happy to see Priyanka join the campaign. Those people have completely forgotten how the nepotism in INC, It's corruption or how it has exploited minorities for its own gain, say Shahbano case.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. In their hatred for Modi and his supporters, these handles seem to support or retweet (fundamentalist) Muslim ideology. For anyone who has spent last 30-40 years observing Indian society must have sure seen the gradual shift in ideology of Indian Muslims too. Sudden religious awakening, donning of beard/Hijab (As a kid, never saw a Muslim woman wearing a Hijab). \n\nIslamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.\n\nTL;DR - how does rejection of Hindutva rationalise support of Islamic fundamentalism?

Them calling themselves liberal is only as legitimate as BJP calling themselves the representatives of Hindus As a muslim I'm wondering that this 'rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values' means.\n\n\nEither way, I'd say the rising Hindutva caused Muslims to move towards a more conservative Islam. The Babri masjid was a culmination of anti muslim efforts that solidified the divide between hindus and muslims. RSS has been hard at work at unifying hinduism and it has done so by othering muslims. no secret there\n\n Whether you like it or not , we live in a pluralistic society so there is no distinction between Indian values and Islamic values , rather it is a superset of all religious values . Islamic extremism and fundamentalism is now a global problem but you are making things worse by giving counter productive measures which are perceived as Anti Muslim sentiment .  I sport a  beard and am an  Hindu. What's how you look got to do with anything ? Isn't it my choice what I wear/What look I sport ? If anybody is forcing me to do something that's a different matter but what are choices that I made of my own volition got to do with hypocrisy .  The problem with most Muslim Indians is that they r usually from lower middle class where religion plays a heavy role. As people become rich they would start becoming more integrated  Who is supporting Islamic Fundamentalism in opposition to Hindutva? It looks like you've been reading a lot of RW Twitter and it's percolated.\n\nThe only difference between your arguments and a generic RW argument is that you've prefaced yours with \"I am a liberal\" with a heavy dose of r/EnlightenedCentrism > Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.\n\nLol no. Even before Independence there was Hindu-Muslim rivalry to the extent that the Muslims wanted a separate country. Most bhakts still bring up Akbar and Aurangzeb and rant about how they destroyed temples and whatnot. \n > I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.\n\nIf you call yourself a liberal after making this bigoted statement that completely whitewashes history, you need to take a long lok at yourself in the mirror.\n\nHatred of muslims is going on this country for decades. Advani led a stupid ac rath yatra to pull down a archeologically significant mosq in 1992, FFS. What has changed is that the present government has made it easy for bigots to come out of the woodwork and wear their bigotry on their sleeves. I'm totally against Modi but I don't support INC either. To be honest I don't support anyone. I just go to BJP posts and write *Gali gali me shor hain, chowkidar chor hain* to get those Chowkidars offended.

    "comment" : " Pakistan's uniform is already army coloured. lol I'm not too familiar with cricketing rules, is it illegal to wear army caps as tribute? If I remember right, the Indian team once wore jerseys with their mothers' names on them, so the caps shouldn't exactly flout ICC's rules....right? Could someone please correct me if I'm wrong? India more or less controls the ICC ICC=BCCI=PIG3  Pakistani Players can wear suicide belt.  They wear Poppies  in English Football League to remember those who died on behalf of their country.\n Is it against rules?

There are too many variables like home/away split, no. of matches they played together, quality of opposition etc. The thing to emphasize here is that they are 'among the best' and it was something unprecedented from Indian team. I remember the time when Venkatesh Prasad's fast deliveries were slower than Kumble's slow ones.\n\nThe current crop have been brilliant. If only our batting line up were a little more consistent overseas, we'd have won more than one Test in each of those series outside of India. If our batting was consistent, we could have won the series in England and Australia.  Is this for when the three of them played together? Or if in one match Umesh was in instead of Shami, for example, would the other two's wickets still add up to the total? Misleading stat. For every other trio they are showing the stats for games all played together, whereas for Indian bowlers their grand totals for the year are taken into account. Bumrah missed first 2 tests in Eng which Shami and Ishant played. For Grand totals Steyn,Ntini,Morkel have 171 in 2008 but they show only 123\n\n\nEdit: looks it’s only away for away tests but it’s not doing justice to other bowlers as their away test matches include not so pacer friendly pitches of subcontinent. \n\nwith Bumrah’s introduction Indian bowling has definitely improved in tests TBH I'm surprised Jimmy+Broad+Woakes/Stokes/Bresnan/Misc don't feature in the top 5. What about the number of matches played? I hope SENA keeps preparing bowler friendly like they have this season.  Some people are laughing that cricket is followed with such a Zeal in a former colonial state... \n\nI mean it's one thing to beat them on their own turf, and another abandoning all reason and sports.  Awesome.. but no terror in the heart .. which Holding and company invoked. Bumrah has really shown immense talent n balled on spot",

It puts tremendous pressure on the state budget, big scams happen and the money which should be put in development for regular citizens goes wasted. All you hear after these events are hosted is how the players had a bad experience, how scams were undergone. No thanks.  oLyMpICs is aNTiNusHnAl No need to call it \"suspended\". It is obvious that if we host game and then don't let some team enter our country boundaries itself, we're modifying the competition. It's a pretty logical thing, and I don't thing we should even bother about it considering the current circumstances. Well we deserve it. I don't see why issues of borders and national security must seep into the fields of sports and the arts where people mostly do it for themselves and not for the glorification of a flag. Yes the Kashmir issue is complicated but that does not mean we prevent people from doing what they want to do when they aren't even responsible for such problems. Waise bhi kabhi nahi karne wale the. What did IOC expect? Give a red carpet welcome for people from a country which killed Indian Soldiers? Worth it. It seems IOC doesn't remember 1972 Germany massacre Good move as we can't afford it. Meanwhile Japan should exhibit the best of the Olympics yet in 2020.,",

    "comment" : " This post summarised my life are you skinny too?\n\nCoz that's will sum up me. I suggest shooting\n\nEdit: tartget shooting g fuckin marksmanship post. Chutya. Start running.  Mine was totally opposite. Till 18, I played Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track&Field and Hockey (sometimes) and was into NCC. I was like crazy into sports, followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc. They used to air sportscenter on ESPN India @8pm which I would watch with full excitement. I played at district level and a couple of cbse clusters. So I'd say for my entire teen years I liked to play and be outdoors most of the time, going around, riding bicycles and doing shit. Well, sadly life took a 360. I moved to a different town, lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college. At college, all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping. In other words, I turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang a little. Well, there's one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness. Football and Badminton helped my leg muscles a lot and I think also helped my height ig. I haven't been to a gym ( to this day ) and don't plan to because I never needed to.\n23 now btw. Life's been depressed for the last 4 years. I get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was. Now everything is shit. \nGood luck to you.\n\n I find outdoor activities useless.\nLets say I play cricket. \n\nWhile batting , I hit a shot. Some cringy kid shouts \"Oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar\". I just stand there and wobble my butt. I waste 30 seconds waiting for another ball.\n\nSome kid does a good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts \"Are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa. Oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii!\"\n\nBatsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt.\n\nBallers shouting oooyeeee after every ball.\n\nFielders clapping because there is nothing else to do.\n\nOutdoor activities are super mega cringy for me. I feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do \"something\" and can not stand idle. Starting off is the hardest part. Pick a sport and try to get into it. You should be able to find Badminton, Tennis, Cricket academies fairly easily. Find a sports complex or the kind. Or move to a building with a clubhouse. That'll be a good start. \n\nI'd recommend gym but typical Indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you're skinny.\n\nI have recently started learning Badminton. The fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off, the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them. \n\nI know people who started learning tennis when I played fairly Well and started bearing me in 7-8 months.\n\nThere are good technical guides to each sport online. By saying that 22 y/o is too late to start playing is a very lame excuse. Get your lazy ass up and start playing a game in which you have interest. You can start with TT, badminton etc.\n\nI am assuming you don't go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining a gym, first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier.\n\nBut seriously dude, GET YOUR LAZY ASS TO WORK Try Playo app.. The more you play the quickly you learn... Also, you can play Squash.. It is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo...  OP, first of all why do you want to get into sports? You say you have realized it is important. I don't deny the benefits, but what is your end goal?\n\nIs it something specific like playing at a professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged?\n\nIf it is the latter, learn like how a child would. Just by playing it for fun. Find some of your colleagues who'd go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for a game. Regularly do that. You will not only learn the sport gradually, but you'll have fun doing it as well. Not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle.  Really depends on where you're from but there's always coaching centers for most sports. No age is too late to join these classes. My uncle started Table Tennis coaching at 40 years age and now he's addicted to it. You gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run.",

There was a case againt dream11 and they won. Google it. Skill games - No ban, but again the decision is taken by the state law.\n\nDream11 & Online Rummy - does not falls under gambling as these games requires skills to play.\n\nThough few states like - Telangana, kerala, assam, nagaland & orissa banned all the games where money is involved.\n\nSupreme court gave rule rummy as game of skill but few states banned it. Although site owners are fighting for this but no result yet. Gambling law in India is a bit complicated. For something to be gambling you generally need the following components:\n\n1. Uncertain event - you don't know what the outcome will be.\n2. Consideration - you're paying something to participate. \n3. Prize - you are competing or participating for a prize.\n\nYou need all three elements. Zynga poker is not prohibited because there is no prize (under Indian law). \n\nGenerally, games of skill are not treated as gambling. Different states have imposed different standards. Telangana took the position that ANY element of chance would make it a game of chance. West Bengal on the other hand, treats poker as a game of skill. This boils down to whether a game is preponderantly that of skill or chance. \n\nThe Supreme Court has some cases in which they decided whether some games are gambling. \n\n1. Horse race betting - game of skill - people can research conditions of horse, skill of jockey, etc. That takes skill. \n\n2. Rummy - game of skill - can learn card combinations, etc\n\n3. Poker (Gujarat HC) - game of chance - no skill involved and poker is preponderantly a game of chance. (Lol)\n\nBasically a lot of things are uncertain until a court decides if a game is predominantly that of skill or chance. \n\n It depends on region to region. That's what I have seen  They'll do anything for money. There's no surprise there. If the company gets caught doing something illegal, the most these cricketers/actors say is, \"sorry, I was not aware of this\".          \nGutka is marketed like it's a cool thing to consume, so pretty much anything goes man.

Earlier, at pubs, one could go solo and mingle with others during the course of the game.

More people we get on legal way of watching things, more things will get to see. Also, feels good to give back to your favourite actors/director/producers.  I'm not sure about the censorship but I'd definitely get it for the sports itself, they have almost all the sports minus wwe and champions League football. Everything else is on it. Sometimes i wonder that myself, I took their one year sports pack to watch the IPL last year and I haven't used it again since... If you are paying it for HBO originals then its fine. I cancelled mine after 2 years because of how horrible their sports streaming were especially premier league. I had a lot of problems with any Man u and Arsenal matches. \n\nI wouldn't recommend it for streaming sports.  don't know much about the shows but their sports plan @299 is totally worth it ( I got it when they were giving 200rs cashback if paid by paytm) Hey guys, Im a hotstar premium subscriber... But I’m not able to stream GOT in 1080p on my iphone. It’s maxed out to 720p. Does anybody face this problem?  Yes. For the serials. Not a sports viewer. Good serials and it streams well most of the time.\n\nThe Apple TV app though is pure shit.  I think it's absolutely worth it if you like TV shows.\n\n It has great shows not available elsewhere like sopranos, the wire, band of brothers, silicon valley, the shield, deadwood, twin peaks, justified, plus nearly every popular sitcom.\n\nAlthough yeah iasip is censored and it does spoil the jokes frequently, like in the pilot they cut out the entire closing scene. \n\nI've had it for several years and I think it's worth the money. I use it for premier league, I paid 200 for a year. In US they recently had a promo for 10$ for a year..! ",

Karlo football mutthi mein Okay hold the downvotes and let's discuss this for a sec. Not a football fan but would love to see indian football succeed and to that end I want to start following it from now on. Reliance is a private entity and I'm not sure why they'd want to to be involved in such a thing and we can of course discuss the visual of a private body doing something like this. But if they are involved I'm sure they're in it for the ₹₹. To eventually own the league formats and take it the cricket board route which is super rich. And so it's in their best interests to not fuck up selection and support it from the ground up. In what ways would they fuck it up? Private body involvement in cricket, hockey, kabbadi have yielded great results. Yeah it's not the traditional 'club' format just a show of such traditions but so what? Not defending Reliance, but i have seen first hand that reliance works/supports at grass-root level in football. My neighbour’s son in 6th standard got picked by reliance academy. Reliance moved him to mumbai, boarding/lodging/schooling and international level training absolutely free of cost. Last i heard, kids were being taken to London for EPL youth academy exposure. If a completly middle class KV schooled kid is being trained for future prospect, I think we should give atleast some credit to Reliance for it. Reliance/Motabhai has a say in *everything* in this country. Ambanis are the Lannisters.",

Hi all,\n\nTo those not aware one of the reasons for India's better showings at Asian Games,CWG and Olympics is due to several previous sportsmen like Geet Sethi, Prakash Padukone, Pulella Gopichand and Rahul Dravid and their foundations [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/) and [GoSports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/) who support several players like Duttee Chand, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Swapna Barman and many more.

Hima Das is absolute beast.  Neeraj Chopra has won the gold !!!! What an athlete.  Four valid throws and all well above 80m. The fact that his least throw was better than silver medalist's best is a testimony of how good the guy is.  8 gold medals denied to India by Bahrain+Qatar. 1 Gold denied to China.\nIf there were no Bahrain+Qatar.\nIndia would have 15 Golds to China's 13 and be number 1 in athletics in Asia. Quite a feat by our athletics team. Holy fack!! 88.06m at the age of 20. Neeraj Chopra, what a guy. So that concludes the athletics events at 2018 Asian Games. What a superb performance by Indian athletics contingent winning 19 medals(7 gold, 10 silver amd 2 bronze).

Basically 1 is sun, 2 is shoe, 3 is tree etc.  \n\nFor instance 1 is sun, I imagine a sheep with wheat instead of wool covering it swallows the sun and is thus burning. A Shepard sees it and runs after it. \n\nThis image is easy to remember because it's so ridiculous. It helped me remember that fire blight of wheat was discovered by Shepard (atleast that was what we were taught). I learnt that many many many years ago. Unfortunately I was too lazy and drunk to put it in practice more effectively but I'm told it works. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci\n\nThere is a solid book called Moonwalking with Einstein which dives deep into application of such techniques. Although that might be a overkill for most people.\n\nAnother technique that I remember they used in fiitjee was repeating tapes of inorganic chemistry as whitenoise while sleeping so that it registers in the subconscious mind. Bihar's school of yoga has some books regarding this, i can't remember. Just google yoga nidra book, has plenty of whacky sleep experiments. If you understand concept then make mindmaps i.e. take important words or formulas or any small definations and structure them neatly. Revise it in your free time for 3-4 days. After that Revise the whole thing again and I am sure you will get it. write down everything after memorizing Revision is the only way to do it. Revise as much as you can. Also practice if it's problem solving.  1. [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)\n\n2.

    "comment" : " I believe everything thing that happened in my life till now is my fault and everything will be. If they said something that I think is wrong then it is my fault that I listened to them and didn't do what I feel was right. It gives you comfort that it was my fault and I wasn't helpless that I was just foolish and I can learn from my mistakes. But it doesn't mean that for every mistake you have to feel bad about it. Humans make mistake. Believe that you did your best in those circumstances and if not then you will learn from these mistakes and not repeat them. Cheers!  No. I wanted to study literature. They gave me freedom to pursue whatever I wanted to. But I don't have any motivational story to share. Following your passion doesn't ensure success. I failed to replicate those 'I followed my passion' success stories. To be frank, now I resent my so called passion. Seems your problem is constantly comparing yourself with others instead of being content in your life. Nothing is set in stone. You can still change things about your life. First of all what exactly is so miserable in your life? Parents guide us based on their experiences of life .Moreover in India , children are social securities in an indirect way.\n\n\n\nDon't crib . Move on . And you can restart tennis . \n What I do is just listen to their suggestions and wait until the right moment has come to tell them what I am actually going to do!\n\nThey call me \"ghaag\" for this behavior. According to them, ghaag is a person who is always consumed in self-thoughts and do not tell anyone what is he/she going to do and never listen to anyone. \n\nThey get mad at me, but in the end, when they see me happy with my decisions, it's all good for them.\n\nI also listen to only myself because in a case in the future if I fuck up with my life, I, by any means cannot blame my parents or anyone because all the fucking decisions were mine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B; Until this point, you have tried what your parents told you, only because you were not passionate enough about whatever you liked.  \n\nThere is no reason for me to think you showed so much promise in Tennis that you would have done fabulously (you have not really told me about the medals you won in your engg college sports activities, or in other external sports championships). \n\nYou knew your parents for 18 yrs. They maybe experts in engg, or they maybe farmers...but basically their advice was given based on their experiences and the best advice they got. If you didnt show enough 'ability' in tennis - how the heck will they know .. you are gifted in tennis ??\n\nIt is easy to sift all the blame onto your parents for it all, but, that will only allow you to blame them for all your future choices too. Maybe it is time to figure out what exactly you want to do with your life and what you are good at and do something. \n\n&#x200B; Parents advise you based on their experience. I don't think their intention was wrong. Tennis and sports actually didn't pay well at last decade or so, you have had to struggle for proper equipment let alone earninh well. I feel it should have been you who should have pushed harder and changed their mindset and showed them that there is potential. Also I guess you are in your early 20s, nothing is stopping you from pursuing something more interesting pehle main karta tha. lekin ab nahin. Now I want me and my future wife to raise my child if I have one to be independent and think for himself. sunne mein to aasaan lag raha hai but bahot mushkil hone wala hai Hmm. My parents fucked up my shit real good. And I still blame them for it. \n\n\nI'm not bitter about it, I mean they didnt fuck my shit up because they wanted to fuck me up. Really just the opposite. They just didnt know any better.\n\n\nIt doesnt change the fact that my shit is good as fucked, for life no less. But I'm done being bitter about it. \n\n\nI'm sure you're angry rn. I'm just saying your anger is valid. Don't take it out on them if you think their actions were motivated out of love and concern. But dont need to stop venting your frustration with friends, online or even to a sympathetic ear. \n\nMy parents saw shitty times where they would collect melt wax and make new candles, to save money. Your parents probably did too. You cant blame them for being aspirationally conservative. Aspirations were a dangerous thing to have back then. \n\n\nEven so, I'm sorry you are in a bad place.",

Same chutiya group support the pro-Nazi groups in hating Muslims and \"halal\" food. Foreign me bhi ye hutiyapa Shuru ho gaya. Oh man..we are just f*cking bunch of parasites spreading shits wherever we go... They happily go and eat in german restaurants selling beef, they suck upto beef eating Germans..but if their own people sells beef or eat beef, then they go nutsss...! Hypocrites...! This reminds me of that Hasan Minaj bit where he compares the Indian diaspora to a biryani \"Keep the weird shit out and bring the good stuff in\" FFS I'm hindu and those assholes don't represent me. Just like the Taliban doesn't represent Muslims. Anyone can eat what they want. Honestly I would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off Objection on beef in Germany? Motherfuckers, this is the land of beef and pork. Fuckers, go back to India. Why the fuck are you even in Germany? Go back inside Modi's arse and eat dhokla. I suppose they were serving Porota Beef.\nNo one comes in between a Malayali and his porota beef. Objecting beef in Germany? Lol, these guys are unbelievable. If you can't tolerate people with different eating habits, maybe you shouldn't be living in places where people have different eating habits than you. Just stay home back in India if you're so close minded. This is is stupid , if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef , why restricting others bc puri duniya k samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe. How much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid, human history and HUMANITY. Keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn't have jurisdiction in Germany",

    "comment" : " > As Ganesh Chaturthi fever gripped parts of the country over the weekend, a section of Hindus were also taking a break from the euphoria to lead a #BoycottRedLabel movement on Twitter — the tea, not the alcohol.\n\n> A seemingly innocuous advertisement of the beverage, released in September 2018, was retrieved from the archives of the world wide web to give parent company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) a hard time.\n\n> The ad shows a Hindu man approaching a Ganpati idol-maker to take home a murti of Bappa for the first time. The elderly idol-maker offers parcels of knowledge about Hindu traditions and tales to his customer, leaving the man suitably impressed. But then, because it’s time for his namaaz, the idol-maker puts on a skull cap, revealing his Muslim identity. The Hindu buyer is surprised, feels betrayed and disappointed.\n\n> *“I have some work today, I’ll come back tomorrow,”* he says, excusing himself from the interaction.\n\n> The idol-maker asks him to at least stay for (Red Label) tea. Facilitated by a glass of chai, the Hindu man’s bigotry disappears when the Muslim man explains why he does what he does: *“Bhaijaan, yeh bhi toh ibadat hai”* (Brother, this is also worship).\n\n> The last frame reads, *\"Inspired by a true story.\"* Boycott culture has officially entered India, but unfortunately, it won't work because most companies in India are monopolies, even the so called bhakts would find it difficult to find alternatives to these everyday things. Perhaps that is why Patanjali is present, but even then, it is sub par and so the Bhakts will silently revert to the quality products they used previously. I searched for the Red Label ad on YouTube and this was the first search result - https://youtu.be/l99pVT8MOXQ\n\nI am speechless 😶. Bhakti is really blind. No one actually follows this in real life outside of twitter.\n\nPeople think twitter represents India and thats just so false. Why do people think that twitter is real India? People wanted to boycott surf excel but nothing happened. People wanted to boycott Zomato but nothing happened.\n\nWe Indians just suck at protests and boycotting. Extremists (Of every religion) are trash. And its sad to see that in this day and age, they have the louder voice in our country. I don't even know where our country is going anymore. \n\"Secular\" is only used in political propaganda and the true meaning of it is already being forgotten. Why are religious people even allowed to sue others with the reason of 'X's words hurt my faith' thats stupid because as an atheist their words hurt my ideology when they force me to pray but can I sue them? No.\nDespite having freedom of religion, we still are not free. [deleted] Reddit crowd is very different here. Almost every comment I read is about how this boycott culture is wrong. Criticising  the majority of the people who think this kind of ads are wrong.\n\n I think virtue signalling about religious differences in Ads and movies is not cool. They think they are helping society by doing this but it absolutely does not. It's a festival of Hindus and you are trying to tell them that they are the real villains on this day ? At this point you are just desperately seeking attention, knowing how the reaction is going to be like.\n\nHow can anyone justify this kind of ad. I genuinely want to know ?\n\nDoes everything has to bring the damn religions in the middle every damn time. It's like they think, they'll get attention only if they bring religion in the middle. Cadburi ads are good, they don't this shit. I don’t give a shit about religion but don’t you think showing hindus always as intolerant and showing muslims as good hearted kinda defeats the purpose of these videos?. Why not show muslims carry pork items       On swiggy to people and say that carrying food is also a type of worship?.",

Been meditating on and off for past month, one thing i have observed is whenever i stop meditating my life turns so fucking upside down, like just last week i posted here about feeling depressed, after one redditor advised me to meditate i started again 2 days ago. Let me tell you guys it had cleared my mind A LOT like i have so less stress now and even when i met a friend from my hometown he said i had changed a lot , low anger issues , understanding and what not. If you are feeling overwhelmed please give mindfulness meditation a try , it does not require a religion or beliefs in any higher power , try using headspace for a week and you will start noticing subtle differences in your day to day lives. If you search the net enough you could also find a 12 month free code for headspace app that unlocks all benefits. If you have time to spare also checkout the 10 percent happier podcast by dan harris and waking up book by sam harris. Hope someone finds this useful! Happened today - \n\nI was in a lift, casually standing against back wall. The was a girl in front of me and she was talking to her friends and appeared clumsy. The lift stopped, more people came in and she had to move back towards wall to let others accomulate.  While in this process, as she was clumsy,  her hand touched my peepee. She was startled and moved her hand away. She looked towards her friends with embarrassment in her face. \n\nYou know rest of the story...\n\nLater virgins.",

Maybe it’s too powerful as a company Nestle is a kind of a serial offender of a company. How the fuck do these fucking companies have the gall to do such shady stuff in India and not in US? First Johnson and Johnson and now Nestle. > Breaking the law, Nestle has conducted clinical trials on 75 premature babies in five hospitals on substitutes for breast milk in complete contravention of the Infant Milk Substitutes Act. It was found by Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) on screening the trial registry of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that Nestle has sponsored a research titled “Multicentric Observational Study to Observe Growth in Preterm hospitalised infants”.\n\n> The trial was conducted on 75 premature babies between the age of 28-34 weeks. The objective of the study was to assess the growth and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. One of the exclusions was that the infant could not be fed milk substitute within 48 hours of birth, but from the third day onwards, the trial suggested that the infant could be given a milk substitute instead of breast milk.\n\n> ... *“They are conducting these trials on premature babies. It is extremely risky. Babies are most sensitive during this period. What would have happened if anything went wrong with these babies,”* asks Amulya Nidhi, co-convenor of Swasth Adhikar Manch. There's no point posting this here and becoming outraged, if you're not actively doing anything to boycott their products. * **Nestle Board Meeting**\n* CEO:  People hated the whole \"Water isn't a human right\" thing, but we're  losing steam on that story.

I'm a Zomato Gold user who was perplexed when a restaurant I frequent suddenly stopped accepting Zomato Gold. Although I sort of argued with them (mildly), once I did my research on it, I fully understand why restaurants would do this. \n\nIn the long run, all this discounting will only hurt both restaurants and customers since restaurants need a margin to run on. They'll have to make up for it somehow and usually it's by increasing prices. \n\nCustomers pay Zomato for Zomato Gold, restuarants pay Zomato to be a part of the Zomato Gold program (else they'll lose visibility -- that's how Zomato sells the whole thing), restaurants take the losses due to the discounts and on top of all this they even pay Zomato a commission per order. \n\nI just don't get what sort of value add Zomato does with its Gold program. (Sure, it has a nice review platform (so does Google) and it needs to make money somehow -- but this is stupid).\n\nIf Zomato Gold manages to capture more and more restaurants all that will happen is the price without the Gold program will increase. And we'll be paying Zomato money every year to eat out at \"normal\" prices which will be the new discounted price. That's assuming Zomato captures more of the market. Hopefully they don't! I am frustrated with how expensive online food ordering is. Goodluck to all the restaurants with the #logout campaign. Delivery services :\n\n\\- They take so much money from restaurant : at least 20 to 25% if you ask them.\n\n\\- They are source of so much plastic garbages\n\n\\- Their drivers are so dangerous (for us and for themselves)\n\nUsing them is somehow supporting this isnt it ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally we use the app to check menus and then we go to the restaurant. :D A lot of people found bottlenecks in the program such as , visiting one restaurant for biriyani and another for sweets only (if you only end up selling only the sweets when you've already made a ton of other stuff you will make a loss). Then there were people using other peoples membership. Some literally took away tons of food using the unlimited clause and paid very less, and kept doing it everyday :P :P \n\nBasically it was a case of a poorly thought out plan where the loss-bearer was someone else. Zomato has since made changes to the program to plug the loopholes.",

We have a liking for masala, colorful and relatively more salty stuff relatively. To a general Indian audience (not the health conscious minority) a rich red/orange gravy will look more appealing than a white looking pasta dish or a grilled meat with seasoning. \n\nHence from a manufacturers perspective, if they want to sell in India then they have to adapt to the local taste and tip on the unhealthy side of the scale by adding more salt sugar and color. It is not India can't produce good food, items exported out of India are generally of good quality. here for a good time, not for a long time YOLO..... Reads this while eating Blue Lays. Our packaged foods might be unhealthy, but in my experience Indians in general eat wayyy less unhealthy packaged foods compared to western countries. There are entire aisles in supermarkets here full of all kinds of chips and sodas.",

This is not just Zomato. Pretty much every VC-funded startup works to burn money aggressively and irresponsibility to drive growth. When the market is mostly captured they fuck over their customers by charging more. Then comes the IPO/takeover stage and the founder walks away stinking rich, while the buyer is left with the mess. all aggregators corp, needs to be evil, in 10 years every aggregators corp gonna fail, It is the deep discounting model which is under fire. The chickens have come home to roost. You cannot continuously offer discounts/free delivery/etc . That is not a healthy way for any industry to run.\n\nThe issue is the Indian urban consumer is sort of already spoiled by these startups now. We were used to cheap rides in nice comfortable cabs, and are now wondering why cabs have got so expensive or hard to book. The biggest shock I got when to moved to another country (developed with much lower population) was that nothing was free. No free delivery anywhere, whether its groceries, food, amazon. Very limited offers/cashbacks/points anywhere. It sort of made me realise how spoiled the Indian urban consumer is (mostly due to very high investments and very low cost of labour and business in general) they pivoted to db as a service. dharam bhrasht /s When you sellout and go corporate, it's the devil's work. To stay profitable they're being assholes. This, unfortunately, is prime capitalism. I don't understand this article, it's just capitalism in action. \"capitalism\" \\>no discounts\n\nWhy bother with them at all?",

    "body" : "The words, \"Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple.\" still rings in my ears. My aunt who never had anything beyond primary school education told me so when I was a kid. My grandmother who never went to school knew that the first atom bomb was detonated in Kurukshetra during the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata. Apparently, this is why not a shred of grass grows in Kurukshetra. Of course, she had not been to Kurukshetra and she had no idea about nuclear physics. But as a child, I had no reason to doubt their wisdom.\n\nIt is said that ignorance is bliss. But I firmly believe that ignorance is a curse. It corrupts the mind of the people. Our ignorant grandparents, uncles and aunts, parents have systematically, though not necessarily deliberately, shoved us towards ignorance and false pride. Their inadequate knowledge blended with haughty confidence has rendered most Indians into pompous fools.\n\nThese fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday, these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning elections.\n\nThe electoral system is terribly flawed. It allows ignorants, uneducated people, idiots to become candidates and since power and money are all that is required, these imbeciles inevitably win elections. But it is not just power and money. People vote. If the people are uneducated, they would not know the value of education and they would help elect ignorants. And so they did. They elected those who would tell them how great a people they are and how quickly they would lead the world. In other words, they elected those who would give them the illusion of becoming a superpower or *Vishwaguru*.\n\nNow that the ignoramus became leaders, it was no longer required to surreptitiously suggest that Newton did not discover the laws of gravity. The buffoons started finding Indic greatness in just about everything and made it their sacred duty to vomit their crazy thoughts publicly. They started investing effort in meaningless researches such as finding the suitability of Sanskrit in programming talking computers. But I hold responsible not just those who never went to school, for being ignorant. Such is the pathetic condition of the education system in India that having MS in Physics is also not enough to make a person educated in Physics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is found in Vedas? Why would a judge claim that peacocks reproduce with their tears? Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice? Why would an MBBS claim that the Vedas postulated a theory superior to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity? These people did go to schools and universities. But unfortunately, these schools and universities failed to give them an education. These universities washed off their hands having given these duffers just their qualification. I blame the worthless education system of India for the burden of ignorance these cretins carry exactly on their shoulders as much I hold responsible the ignorant parents these people had.\n\nWhen ignorants come to power, they lead the country towards intellectual bankruptcy. It heralds the onset of disaster for a nation. Such a scenario was seen during the 1930s in Germany when the Nazis came to power. They claimed weird and unfounded theories about science, anthropology and history. They invested time, manpower and money in worthless researches. They promoted occultism and pseudoscience. They made racial laws based on pseudo-Darwinism.\n\nWhen ignorants achieve power, they also want glory. They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race. It pumps false pride and prejudices in the people. It propels society towards collective lunacy. To assert their perceived supremacy, such a deluded nation ends up declaring war on other nations. Whether India follows such a destructive path or not, will be seen in a very near future. But the symptoms are already visible. There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.",

    "comment" : " I would like to add a few more points\n\nOur education is failure maybe because our society is obsessed with percentages rather than the knowledge gained. The evaluation is so flawed that if you know the tricks you can literally write a movie script for any question and still score full marks for it.\n\nPeople with degrees who earned it by cheating, tricking, and false evaluation are no less than the uneducated and ignorant mass. Some of these people again use loopholes in the job market and attain high positions in companies only to belittle the hardworking ones. There was a country of imbeciles, all of whom secretly harbored delusions of their own greatness.\n\nBut they were ruled by a select few who, while being of the same stock as the imbeciles, had risen above their level of stupidity by virtue of having access to an education system that was denied to the vast majority.\n\nThis elite took advantage of the general brainlessness that prevailed among the masses, and ruled over them simply by impressing upon them that they *were* stupid, and needed someone intelligent to rule over them. \n\nBut this went on for long enough, and then some among the many woke up to the fact that if the imbeciles were in a majority, why not instil among them the idea that their imbecility, far from being a bane, was in fact a virtue? Thus, they could overthrow the elite - who had in any case let generations of opulent living dull them into a lazy corpulence - and become the rulers themselves.\n\nThis worked better than even they had hoped, for the imbeciles were tired of whispering their inanities among the like-minded few - or so they had thought. In fact, the mindless were an overwhelming majority. Upon realizing that for the first time, the rulers did not look down upon their stupidity, but in fact echoed their inane blathering, they began in ever-increasing numbers to shout out evidence of their own idiocy from the rooftops. \n\nThus, for the first time in this country's history, the ruled had found themselves in complete harmony with their rulers. > They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race.\n\nThose who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past\n\n- George Orwell in 1984 Every nation gets the government it deserves.\n\n\\-Joseph de Maistre I live in the UAE and I used to wonder how ISIS took over Syria. Last month my Syrian neighbor said, \"We all supported ISIS because they talked about our religion, nationalism and the most glorious past of Syria that they were trying to bring back. We all stood by and watched as ISIS massacred our own brothers and sisters because they promised to make Syria great again, the saddle of creation that it once was, the real Syria that the whole world respected . But they just wanted to make some money from our oil fields.\" This government is of the unkils, by the unkils and for the unkils.\n\nWe should thank our luck for there still being such a thing as internet.\n\nI taught myself evolution by natural selection until I grokked it thanks to the internet (especially books by Dawkins and BBC and PBS documentaries). I taught myself interesting ideas discovered by astronomy thanks to the Teaching Company. I learned to be skeptic and think critically thanks to Novella's Skeptic Guide to the Universe podcast. I learned about how our debt-based world economy has been stuttering through booms and busts since Nixon's 1971 decision. I learned from Nate Hagens about how surplus energy is the driver of economy, not money. I learned what science has learned about plants by watching Chamovitz course on Coursera.\n\nI learned why Indian science didn't develop after 1200 A.D. by watching [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhnQR7xxRg) by Breakthrough Science Society.\n\nYou won't believe how awed I feel every day.\n\nBut I also understand that the civilization as we know it is heading for collapse by 2050. So, there's some sadness too. I am *learning to die in the anthropocene*. You fail to understand education system. Education is nothing more than a social experiment. It only helps the individual to conform to the societal norms. Societal norms keep on changing with the tide of time. The current acceptability standards in Indian context are towards a majoritarian cultural and nationalistic tendencies. Education will only fall in line to create individuals who conform to those standards. Just wow!\n\n🍪 Gold toh nahi hai, cookie from my side. >Such is the pathetic condition of the education system in India that having MS in Physics is also not enough to make a person educated in Physics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is found in Vedas?

I don't agree with it but I understand why people don't want to eat at beef/pork. Are people really that offended that their meat was blessed by a muslim cleric? It's not like it's going to taint the meat, is it? Aren't those throwing a fit supposed to be vegetarians in the first place? They have option to not go for meal to McDonald’s. As a vegetarian I will never understand the ibsession with the type of meat. You can very well go to McDonalds and have McVeggie with Cheese. Why boycott? Are these people even the main demographic for McD? Nothing's going to happen. I hope McD stands up to these internet trolls. Personally I don't like the halal practice, because it seems very painful to the animal. The jhatka method seems faster and cleaner. If we must kill animals, IMO its best to make it quick and as painless as possible.\n\nHowever I have heard that halal just looks painful but its actually not, so idk. [removed] Halal vs Jhatka is just manufactured controversy \n\nJhatka is horrible too. The animal is completely conscious when the head is cut off - god knows what happens. \n\nStunning before removing the blood seems to be much more humane. The same bigots were supporting iskcon not adding garlic and onions in midday meals\n\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/jun/08/the-garlic-onion-debate-what-akshaya-patra-midday-meal-row-is-all-about-1987635.html\n\n>It found itself in the midst of a controversy after an article in a national daily claimed that school-children in Karnataka were not happy with the food provided by the organisation as it lacked garlic and onion\n\n>The call for more donation to the organisation was given by author Anand Ranganathan.\n\n>\"The only way bigoted, illogical, anti-science, Hinduphobic vested interests can be silenced, is when you put your money where your mouth is. Please donate to @AkshayaPatra. And do reply with a confirmation that you have done so. Very grateful. Thanks,\" he said in a tweet on Friday while giving a link to the donation page of the organization.\n\nThat guy is the founder of swarajya mag. They will defend not adding garlic and onions in government mid day meals paid by taxpayers. But they will call for boycott of private company like Mcdonald.\n\nI wonder what these guys would do if people protested for beef in government mid day meals I thought the biggest selling point for the \"indic\" faiths was that they were not scriptural. How is this jhatka nonsense different from the halal nonsense?\n\nAnd it's hilarious to see shuddh shakahari brahmins living in California crying about denial of livelihood to dalits, while I have yet to see any dalit crying about halal. \n\nDuplicity, thy name is hindutva!",

I used to throw my pizza container boxes to the dustbin in Pizza Hut etc. in South India. Nobody ever even looked.\n\nBut in one of the North Indian cities, when I did the same, the entire joint looked at me, murmured stuff, stared at me for the next two-three minutes I was there. So never did it there again. Not ever in the North.\n\nThis is about fast food joints.\n\nI never think of cleaning after me in traditional restaurants. no they will not lose their job btw hello nice person! Our great country still runs on Manusmriti ideoloy\nCleaning trash is considered as a demeaning job even if its yours . I remember 10 years back we had no such privileges at McDonald's. Everyone had to put their own thrash in the bin. May be with the increased footfall, they started this. If they’re disposable items, I ask one of them where do I dispose this off. Most of the times, they appreciate the gesture but prefer to do it themselves because of their bosses. \n\nIf washable dishes, it’s better to just leave it on the table. Yeah we always pick our stuff up and leave them in the trash can. No two ways about it. I usually do that in food courts of malls I personally clean up the table so all he has to do is pick up & drop my trash in a dustbin.",

Oh them Japanese and their phallic naans All suffixed with Curry Hahaha love the spiciness index but having eaten there the top of that scale is probably a low 4/10 here. 850 Yen (appx Rs. 600) for a \"thali\" containing 2 curries, rice, one naan, salad and a lassi.\n\nHonestly i thought food in Japan was a lot more costlier than that. Apparently they have the highest prices for fruits in the world. Lived there for an year or so. There are Indian curry chains probably every block or so(in Tokyo only) , owing to the lower costs of running them.\n\nA lot of them don't have actual Indian chefs and run by people from Indian sub continent but not from India. Look how they massacred my naan! That dick shaped naan though :D Mutton curry looking like a bowl of tomato soup! I wonder if it tastes the same or more like anime Blueberry Lassi !!",

    "comment" : " Long ago, I had imagined of a time when McD in India would serve pork and beef alongside its offerings. Looking at the current trends, I don’t think it’ll happen in my life. It’s one of the reasons I also shifted to local burger joints that do serve pork, beef, as well as halal chicken. \n\nServing halal chicken is just convenience. In many parts of India, the concept of jhatka is absolutely unknown. I’ve not come across a single restaurant that serves jhatka meat or an individual demanding jhatka meat through these many years of eating out, which is why most places don’t serve jhatka meat. Given the vitiated climate these days, it’s only recently that even the concept came to be known. But even then, a restaurant has the right to serve whatever it wants to serve. \n\nI personally love bacon and beef patties. I don’t call for the boycott of restaurants that don’t serve them because they don’t serve my dietary preferences, nor do I barge into a vegetarian restaurant and demand that I should be served meat and why they’re imposing vegetarianism on me. You see, you’ve a choice to eat there — if you don’t want to eat there, don’t. By calling for boycotts and other coercive measures, you’re trying to browbeat a company. That doesn’t bode well for investor’s sentiment. Let us say they boycott McD, let’s say McD closes down. Do you not realise the kind of direct and indirect impact that can have on the economy? Which company or person would want to start a business in this climate, where you’re damned if you do, and damned if you don’t? This is not just with McD. We’ve seen this happen with Zomato, Ubereats, Snapdeal, Amazon and even IRCTC. We have become absolutely stupid, to be honest. I don't get the stupidity of trending this. Every food outlet will try to over Halal as other meat aren't accepted by a religion that is largest or second largest in the world. That is a huge market, why would McDonalds give up this market.",

    "comment" : " Had been to Hong Kong few months ago. Had fee dishes there. We make it spicy and also use way too much garlic predominantly in Indo Chinese. I've had Chinese food in authentic Chinese restaurants here in Mumbai and also from Indian- Chinese restaurants and I prefer the Indian twist. I find authentic Chinese a bit  bland for my taste. Even the spicy Sichuan ones have a numbing spice to them which I don't think will satisfy the Indian palate.\n\nThere are variations of Chinese food served abroad since Chinese immigrants there have had to tinker with the recipes to suit the locals taste . I've had American- Chinese cuisine when I was in the States and found it sweeter and more fatty/greasy compared to here.\n\nMoral: **Indian Chinese cuisine FTW** Very different.\n\nCheck Trevor James on Youtube (The Food Ranger), He has covered chinese cuisine extensively. Its just indo-chinese. Real chinese food is not like that. Day and night. China like India has different regions with thier own cuisine. The chinese street food we eat resembles food from sichuan  regionof china. To give an example, cantonese food is not at all spicy and actually bland n cold All you need to do is watch a few travel shows on China and you can tell the differences yourself. Their cuisine is very diverse. Very very different. Was in Singapore a couple of months ago.  \n\nIts mostly soupy but bland and its definitely an acquired taste. Chinese food is mostly pork and sea food in terms of meat. It is Indo-Chinese. Some of the cooking styles are similar. However, punjabi masalas have mutated with Chinese and we now have the Indo-Chinese cuisine. The street food is basically totally unrecognisable to Chinese people. If you go to local Chinese restaurants, a few basic staples and ingredients have been totally modified with Indian flavours and techniques. Even if you go to expensive Chinese restaurants which claim to serve authentic food, it has been modified to serve our tastes, but the dishes atleast are a familiar.  \n\nAlso, north east and nepali cuisine is a very distinct cuisine, which is separate from Chinese cuisine. It's not the same thing. It's sort of like generalising and calling Pakistani food and Andhra food the same thing (which a lot of Europeans and Americans probably might do). My bad by bland i meant less spicy I doubt if you could find authentic Chinese cuisine in India. What  you eat in India is \"Indian Chinese\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Chinese_cuisine\n\nFrom what I have talked with Chinese people, the cuisine is very region specific and not spicy as you would expect. I have been to couple of Chinese restaurants in Canada, and  I came back hungry because a) Very few vegetarian options 2) Even with vegetarian options, most of them involve noodles and steamed vegetables. I believe even vegetarian options might be more suited for general Canadian population including Indians.\n\nAlso, I would thoroughly avoid their dessert. What I have seen is they tend to be rice based and gelatinous - not a fan of that texture.\n\nTL;DR - what you normally see in India is not authentic Chinese food.",

    "comment" : " >Do they think these heavy discounts are harmful to their business if they continue long term?\n\n*Uber* is yet to make a single naya paisa in profit and that's because it subsidises riders, even in the West. The goal of these companies is to achieve market dominance and then gradually raise prices so that they become profitable entities. This may not always work of course. There comes a point when investors shall no longer be able to bear losses. This may happen to *Uber*. There's a lot of chatter about them just burning money. It's not going to happen to *Amazon* though, they are too big to fail, at least for now. When it comes to raising prices, [*Swiggy* and *Zomato*](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/zomato-swiggy-burning-hole-your-pocket-heres-truth-800403) have already started doing it. Kirana stores have been doing this for decades now . Open a kirana store - get discount from supplier by promising long term and high inventory. \nNow sell items at close to 0 op-margins, with low procurement price and lower markups. You start establishing a consumer base in locality\n\nAll food aggregators are doing same now. They bring huge customer base to restaurant. In return demand discount on price, pass on more discounts in forms of ads and promotions. Only to achieve one goal of customer retention. Food aggregators can probably work in the long run in India because of labour surplus. The business model will fail in developed countries because the cost of labour is very high.",

Post that here too. >Delivery guy ran away with food.\n\nI am sorry, but I laughed out loud reading this. OP, you're an idiot, and you don't know how to deal with issues. If the tracking did say the order was picked up and then there was no response, how the hell can you call it \"Delivery guy ran away with food?\" I'm calling you an idiot because you keep repeating that exact phrase in this thread as if you saw him running away with your food. It could have been an issue with the restaurant where they they couldn't fulfill your order hence fake processed it until the tracking starts. Someone else near your house could have taken it from the delivery guy because free food. Whatever, learn how to state your problem correctly. Mention only the things that you know for sure.\n\n> \"I haven't received my food, and the delivery person is not receiving my calls. I was tracking the order and I witnessed the order being picked up and the delivery person moving towards my address, but I have not got my food yet.\"\n\nNot:\n\n> My order was picked up and the delivery guy ran away with it\n\n> This is the truth\n\nI'm sure you would have said something similar in the Zomato review, and that is why your review was removed. Ordered Dry Manchurian from Zomato. Received fried onions. Called the restaurant & he said \"Sir, manchurian khatam ho gaya tha!\" Messaged Zomato Support. Initially said no for refund. After 15 minutes of my asking to call me or transfer to somebody senior, gave me a refund. Actually this might have gotten Zomato in legal trouble(even though they would easily win, they don't even want to take chances of litigation). You claimed  (i believe you personally) that the restaurant committed a crime so that can have serious legal consequences. My restaurant consistently gets 4 or 5 star ratings on Zomato, and still our rating shows as 3.7 on the site. Super buggy, super rigged even for restaurants. Allegations are bad stuff on reputation based systems.\n\nWhen it’s an information/social system it’s worse. Either it’s too easy to mass produce allegations and destroy competitors, or it’s too easy to generate reviews and game the system.\n\nTo stop this, people end up watching their review pages like hawks, and clean up anything they can, in any way they can. There was no delivery guy. The restaurant made an empty claim and you hallucinated that there was a delivery guy. What I understand is you didn't see the delivery guy ran off but he did mark the delivery as fulfilled. You should be writing the events as you saw in app. Not infer that the agent ran away. It becomes a bold allegation and hence removed. \n\nThe restaurant is certainly at fault for the failure, maybe their modus operandi. But your allegations are definitely unsubstantiated. Please write to us the review, maybe censor any privacy-related names of the restaurant and your locality.\n\nAlso, the review on Zomato seems as if it was removed by Zomato, not the Restaurant. Try sending the review again.",

Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best. The thing that does not kill you only  makes you stronger. I'm allergic to shellfish. Indians are least fussy about this. The only thing you will get warnings about is egg and meat. Maybe because some allergies are hereditary.",

Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for 130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses\n\nCan you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that Zomato is giving, when Zomato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them? Update\n Some of you have some common questions which I will answer\n\nAs for source simply call Zomato ask them you want to sign with them what's the contract they offer it. Will not be below 25% \n\nPeople saying without them I would not have orders that far its true but I before they started their own delivery (Zomato) my boys would go 7-8 kilometers for even a order worth 160  Zomato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since. Then have been going for 7-8. Kilometers \n\nLastly to end this topic Zomato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw. Materials from them only which is known as hyperpure which. Will become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even Swiggy is buying. Spaces taking restaurants. Under that space and selling the restaurants item under Swiggys name  as someone who's been  in the industry for 12. Years you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants ! > Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !\n\nCheating is strong word. They aren't cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory. \n\nDon't restuarant owners have unions? If not, you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies. In Zomato and Swiggy's war for customerbase, small businesses suffer. It's the same thing with Uber taxis; they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare. Also restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss, so you both are riding the same boat. \n\nI'hv noticed this numerous times in different cities, try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person, you'll notice they'll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato. OP, let me tell you how to solve this problem but you'll have to become a little tech savvy for that! \n\nIn Pune, there is a restaurant called \"Behrouz Biryani\" who were facing similar problem as yours, let me tell you how they solved it. I used to order biryani from there through Zomato. When I repeatedly ordered biryani about 4-5 times, they texted me a special offer: If I purchased through **their** app in the Play Store (instead of Zomato), they'll give me an additional whopping 20% discount compared to the present price!\n\nI figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours. Zomato, the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they (Behrouz Biryani) had their own app in the Play Store, people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now. They'll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long time.\n\nTry that OP, app development is not that difficult these days. Catch a trustworthy techie and either he'll code it himself for you, or he'll know a freelancer friend who'll do it. The future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race. We know. Most of us still order for the convenience. The argument put forth could be that Zomato/Swiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person, and so any business is good business, no matter how small the margins may be.\n\nHowever, on further thinking, the food app economy is killing the \"lets go out for dinner\" economy. So less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online, which will cut into your normal profits, and limit your ability to maintain rent/electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant.\n\nI think the end-game is to have every outlet on Zomato/Swiggy eventually turn into a kitchen-front only, working on minimal margins, with the 'middle-man' taking most of the profit, just for providing what used to be a free service (Menus + calling restaurants for delivery). Similar findings could be made in the Uber/Ola economy etc. \n\nSad, but this is late stage capitalism at work. Please stop supporting Zomato. I was at a roll stall yesterday and I asked the seller about how Zomato earns as a middleman-service when you're the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you. He explained it to me and I was like, \"So how does it benefit you if they charge you money?\". He said, \"They bring us work.\". I was like, \"Do they?\". And he responded, \"No, not really. We're making the same as before, except now Zomato takes away a portion of our earnings.\" Hi OP, a quick question for you.\n\nLet's say you're selling a burger via swiggy for 140 (MRP)\nIf I were to eat at your restaurant, will I be charged the same?",

Any other state with this kinda jail food popularity? This reminds of the days back when I was in my hometown. There's a central prison in it and its prisoners used to grow vegetables and sell them to the general public. A real \"Kaidi Kitchen\" For those who are concerned with profiteering.\n\nThe money goes back to the upkeep and expansion of the kitchen, ingredients, and wages to the prisoners. The wages are quite low around 100 Rs per day IIRC and for good reason. They have been doing it for more than a decade I think. In Trivandrum at first, they used to send vans to places around the city where the policemen would sell food packets. Usual spots would be around Government hospitals. They expanded the program to start vegetable farms and poultry farms within the jail. They also started a restaurant next to the prison, which is very popular. This is just an extension of services since Swiggy and Ubereats have expanded rapidly in Kerala. Huh. The more you know. Would love to taste it. There is a good chance that one of those inmates is doing time for poisoning someone's food. No thanks.",

Can’t blame them for feeling the way they feel. \n\nI think the most important thing for them is to have a friend circle. Most of their angst will be seeped in. But then again, it’s not a full proof solution. My father is really short tempered and looses his shit over trivial issues. I’ve been working towards getting him engaged in some kinda hobby but it hasn’t worked out. \n\nIt’s a weird place where most of the Indian middle class is right now. Economic and social changes in last fifteen years have been really fast paced. We, the young ones have somehow coped up to an extent but our parents haven’t been able to. It’s not fair to expect it from them. I don’t have a solution but I want you to know that there are many of us out there. You are not alone. Bring them to USA for six months. Either they will assimilate so well that there won't be any practical or logistical hinderances anymore or they will go back with a newfound respect for India. Ask him to stop watching the news on TV! My father watches TV all the time, and believe me, our news channels are milking anger and making people angrier. Newspaper is so much better but news videos on youtube are cancer.\n\nMy father lived in the US with me for 6 months. He loved it but he also realized how good things are for *him* in India. He was shocked when I paid 200$ for carpet cleaning :) :). Grass is always greener on other side\n\nHe secretly (maybe unbeknownst to himself) is jealous of your situation and wishes to live life like you since he never got such a chance. PSU townships and company towns are comfortable compared to unorganised Indian cities, move them to a gated community. I have an uncle who is similar. Complaints fuck all about every single thing in India. I would say you also complain about things in the US - the high cost of living, healthcare, etc.\n\nI think he looks at US or other developed countries and thinks it is utopia and that frustrates him about living in India even more. So a little dose of reality should help them keep their expectations more realistic. Has he ever been to the US? Why don't you take them for a short trip? I am sorry if this may sound disrespectful or intrusive(no offence intended) If ur parents are retired from a PSU wouldn't they be getting a good pension? > The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India. Every little thing irks the hell out of him. \n\n> - Milk price went up by single-digit rupees, he is angry, \n- the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. \n- The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. \n- Modi demonetized, he is angry. \n- The neighbours work two jobs (husband and wife) and don’t have time to socialize - he is angry.\n\nOP. Are we related? This sounds exactly like my mom and dad. Just bitch about how miserable you are there and how the good things in india aren’t available there and how it’s too cold or hot or wet it is. And how you are racially abused and even the Indians aren’t united. They have caste and regional groupings even there. IMO Its not the money your parents are concerned about.\n\n**If our country, its economy and infrastructure is going to shit, we all should be angry irrespective of how much money we've got !**\n\nI understand that you may have reasons to not stay in US or get them there but frankly I don't see any reason to blame someone who recognizes the seriousness of multiple chronic problems in Indian wants to get away from them.",

One of the reasons these apps are so popular here probably is because while the food in the restaurants is decent, the ambiance is terrible at most restaurants.

Sometimes crunchiness or freshness takes a hit, but when it doesn't, online food ordering is wonderful. The bandwagon effect is too damn prevalent in Hyderabad. Take any fucking thing, once fire catches, everyone would be doing the same thing. Everyone watches the same comedy shows, everyone watches the same movies, everyone goes to 'ram ki bandi' at 12am and everyone visits Charminar in the night to feel they're the 'cool' guys.\n\nEveryone seems to be using swiggy now. My 8 year old nephew, my >50 year old parents inclu. I know many college kids who now deliver on swiggy for pocket money, and the next day they'd ordering from swiggy to spend that money. It's so funny. They don't deliver to my place. 😞 How is Hyderabad a Tier-2 city? I am from a small town. A suburb of Mumbai though. Swiggy & Zomato do not even provide service here. Now we have our own exclusive app. Almost spent 7-8k on online food orders , people are becoming more lazy and eating more outside food without even going out.  \nthis will lead to more health issues as we all know about the hygiene standards and ingredients at restaurants.",

I guess Upma is calorie rich with the ghee and all? Blend 100gm oats, one big scoop of peanut butter, one big banana and 250ml milk(or soy milk if you can't take milk). Add curd/yogurt if you want.

    "comment" : " > The comments from the minister came after it was reported that a toilet in Madhya Pradesh's Anganwadi centre at Karera was being used for preparing food for children. she could have admitted fault or even asked for time to look into the matter.\n\nWith this, there is no way things are going to improve for Anganwadi now. How the fuck we allow such baboons to represent us. I agree : Let's make toilets inside temples.\n\nCheckmate BJP  jiske name me hee mithai ho, usse zyada umeed nahi mijhko A few centuries ago, the taboo on shitting near home and water kept people safe. She is still with the taboo, when she justifies cooking food inside toilet because its the age of indoor toilets. We can't expect better from the people soon. This is revolting Lol\n\nBetter than having 600 million street poopers Why do they defend this shit?\n\nThey just need to say 'We are looking into this issue and will take appropriate action once we ascertain the facts'.\n\nIt's that's simple. And our ministers cannot even do this. I can't fathom their logic. They act similar to a dog that was given a bath because it was dirty. And post the bath,at the first  given opportunity, the dog will jump back right into the mud. They just can't stand staying clean. Hey if the pot is not used and filled with gravel like the article says I don't really see a problem. In my house one such small toilet is a storage room.",

F\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g A! If they are trying to launch a commercial business out of it, I hope they are paying the inmates wages equivalent to what they would get outside for a similar job. I also hope that part of the profit goes towards development within the prison. I've tried these prison made foods. They are very very nice and cheap. I hope this works out properly A great idea! But I'm not so sure about jail hygiene, from what I have heard about conditions in jail. Brilliant. Getting them to work. I don't understand why anybody can think this is a good idea. Looking at prison labor as profit is a dangerous slippery slope, not to mention that the laborers are being denied the fruits of their labor. This is highly unethical. No one should make money from prison or prisoners. If you don't want to waste the products prisoners create, give them for free. Good way to smuggle stuff. > The state prison department is also considering a proposal to open  portals of one of its central jails for common people to spend a day and  night there to get the ‘feel’ of jail life by charging a fee. \n\n:-).",

A fellow teenage Indian has taken r/Tinder by storm and here I am, just spending days beating my meat! Exactly a month ago someone promised me a beer treat in South Delhi when I was broke. Kind people exist but get lost soon :( So there was this street puppy that was born near my home. I used to give her roti, milk etc every day twice a day since her mother brought her out from the dry drain shelter (in which she had given birth). In about a month or two, the puppy was in good health and a rich black shiny fur. But then she (puppy) died suddenly. Something happened to her and she didn't eat for 2 days and died on the 3rd. Her death affected me so much emotionally, I was surprised. So I have decided not to own a dog, because I just can't imagine the grief when a dog dies (naturally) after 10-15yrs. Also, this whole Area51 shit is making Reddit completely insufferable the past week. [deleted] Hey, how are you guys? Learnt anything new this year? Any life lessons? Any disappointments?

    "comment" : " Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)\n\nI love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. \n\nTarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are \"saag\"  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. \n\nThen there are all the pickles and chutneys. \n\nMost things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. \n\nI'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both \"a garland in a monkey's hand\" and \"a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand\". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. \n\nTo those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says \"waiting for the number six bus\" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. \n\nWhat you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..\n\n\"What are those Mr Johal?\" \n\n\"They're samosas RajBandar\" \n\n\"What's a surmiser?\" \n\n\"Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge\" \n\nI thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *\"Biskoot?\"* \n\nIf any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.\n\nEdit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ❤️ Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..\nHave tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. \n\nTastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi",

Swiggy support over phone said to me \"Sir we can deliver food from the restaurant you order.\" I'm pissed. I took it up in twitter and alerted Swiggy and Burger King. Swiggy escalation team calls me and offers me an option of refund of money or a coupon. I'm yet to receive either. Now there is only deafening silence.\n\nI'm putting up this post to warn you people, that if you use Swiggy, please be careful. Please see the images that I've posted. The sad part is their escalation team accepted that there is a mistake and yet they don't care that they need to refund the money.

The images are ambiguous. Does burger king even give samosa? I once accidentally ordered from burger Singh instead of Burger King.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBurger King lost a customer from that day. Lol. Another ignorant post from someone who doesn't know how food delivery and aggregator app works. \n\nYou got the food from where you ordered. Swiggy didn't \"sell\" you anything from \"fake\" place. \n\nSwiggy isn't at fault here, they will list anyone which legit restaurant.  And it seems Burger Kings is legit. \n\nThe people running burger kings are at fault here. They just gamed the system but it is upto Burger King to protect their trademark and not swiggy's.\n\nOpen a restaurant named Pizza Huts all you want, it's only pizza hut's problem and no one else. \n\nGoogle about Starbucks and SardarBaksh. That Murugan Idly logo tho....\n\nDAE see what I see? Swiggy and zomato have both become massively shiet..... \n\nWherever I open the app it says 25 minutes, as soon as I place the order it says 35..... I'm lucky if the order comes in 45\n\nZomato being far worse has kept me waiting for 90 minutes with their constant useless update \"saaar your order is on it's way and arriving shortly\" You didn’t miss anything. Why anyone would eat the crap served by Burger King, kfc and other chutiya chains while there are hundreds of alternatives is beyond me. The real question is, how was the burger? Go for Truffles \"All American Burgers\" with Lemon Iced tea. It's a treat to have it every weekend for me.",

KFC, Taco Bell etc in Delhi have started using paper straws. McDonalds have gone 1 step ahead and stopped giving straws altogether. OP has been dining under a rock so far. I had these in Mumbai as well but they don't really last long. Must be soiling after a few minutes. I have seen that in quite a few restaurants/movie theatres in Kolkata.\n\nBut they are not a very good idea at all, as they don't last very long! Especially when you are watching a movie, and sipping your Coke slowly for 2 hours... after about half an hour the paper straw starts disintegrating, and it doesn't work any more! I generally asked for 3 or 4 straws and kept replacing them after 15-20 minutes. That's why a lot of places have stopped using them, since customers complained. Same in Navi Mumbai. Lot of restaurants now do that. Even in Mumbai. I got a shocked reaction from shop keeper when I asked for Plastic straws. He told only paper straws. Rs. 2 for each. Hello caveman! Is that beer ? You having beer with a straw ?",

    "comment" : " 35K is good amount to live in bangalore and can save much as well.\n\n1. Bachelor - look out for PG which allows to prepare food of your own (5K to 7K max) based on your work location.\n\n2. Purchase rice cooker with extra bowl\n\n3. Prepare your own food\n\n4. Avoid malls as much as possible. Once in 2 months is better\n\n5. If you booze, bring it your room and have it rather than going to pubs.\n\n6. Do not buy unnecessary gadgets.\n\n7. Most important open ppf account + auto schedule savings so that you won't be spending much.\n\n8. If you love traveling, use trains which is lot cheaper way\n\nI lived in bangalore for 4 years with 30k as my salary For a simple lifestyle: home cooked meals, taking buses/metro for travel, not going out much, renting a room, ₹35k should let you live comfortably and save some too.\n\nFor a more lavish lifestyle, going out for food/drinks often, taking cabs/autos for travel, renting a single BHK(in a good part of the city), ₹35k can become 0 very soon in a month.\n\nSo based on your habits, one can either make it or break in Bangalore. Post in r/Bangalore I haven’t lived in Bangalore for a few years now but my guess is that if you look hard enough you may get a decent single room for ~ Rs 10 - 15k. You can stay in a PG which even served food for much cheaper.       \n\nObviously there’s no limit to how much you can spend .. even 1 lakh per month if you go out just in weekends to fancy pubs and bars but if you cook at home, and go out occasionally you can live decently. General Rule - Don't spend more than 25% of your salary on rent.  Which means 8.75k. \n\nSave before you spend. Open a separate account and park money there as savings. Don't touch this money except in case of emergencies. I strongly suggest saving 25% of your salary. Since you are quite young. You can just go for liquidity and not invest anything for at max 2 years ( But I seriously suggest investing as soon as you can).\n\nMake your own food. Cooking is a skill which every person should have. Yes it might be convenient to hire a cook/ tiffin service, but none will match the hygiene and nutrition of dishes you can make yourself. Food deliveries should be reserved for special occasions or once in a while lazy nights. \n\nDrinking/Dining out  is very  expensive. Should be a bi-monthly affair at the most. Travelling expense will depend on the location of your room and office. But who are we kidding this is banglore will be a 1hr affair at the very least. I hope metro's service has improved since I was last there. For a long commute bus/metro is the only option. For a short commute you'd be much better buying an old 2-wheeler.   \n\n\nIn an ideal world. \n\n25% - Rent\n\n25% - Savings\n\n25% - Living Expense( Groceries, Travelling, Bills)\n\n25% - Investment. This is about my friend. He stays in a 2bhk high profile apartment with his friend at Domlur near Indira Nagar. So he gets a bedroom, bathroom and balcony whole for himself. Monthly rent is 28k. They share, so he pays 14k per month. They have a gym in the club facility in apartment.\n\nThey hire a domestic help who comes daily and clean the house including bathroom. Monthly expenditure for that is 2000. They hire a cook who come daily morning and evening and cook for three times a day. Her payment is 5000 per month. The average amount for groceries a month is Rs 5000. Since they divde this, each person spends 6000.\n\nHis office is just nearby, so he walks daily. If at all he can't monthly travel expenditure would come maximum 2000. Internet and electricity would come upto 1000 per person.\n\nThese are his bare minimum expenditure. Considering your case, I can say you will have 12k at hand after spending so much and living luxuriously. With that you can eat out, travel, party or save. Solo 1bhk-2bhk Rent : 12-15k\n\nMaid(s) : 5k\n\nInternet, Mobile, Electricity, Cable : 3k\n\nGroceries for one person : 5k\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat leaves you with about 7k pm. I am assuming you are to commute by office shuttles/cabs and for other travelling even if you use Ola/Uber, an average of 4 trips per week at about 150/- it comes to about 2.5k for commuting.\n\nThat still leaves you with 4.5k to splurge on entertainment - movies, meals, shopping etc\n\nNot much left, but then this is the cost of comfortable living, you could choose to go the PG route or share an apartment with friends and save on rent, maid, groceries etc. To be true, it depends on how  frugally you can live.\n\nThe rent can be anywhere from 7k to 15k.  \n\nFood depends on you, are you good with skipping the dinner and having milk and fruits, thus saving some money and keeping your systems in check.\n\nHave a heavy lunch, that too depends on where your job is, is the company providing meals or you have to uber or zomato the meal.  \n\nCommute can be anywhere from ₹10 in a local bus to ₹70 for an Uber auto for the same distance. I'm spending about 25k for expenses monthly. That too, I'm living a pretty luxurious lifestyle. I think 35k is good enough for a bachelor Just above bare minimum.",

This is an ineffective strategy. He should havd been standing at the food stalls warning of the consequences. There's a restaurant in Pune, Durvankur or something which only serves thali and gives 50 discount (on 200 something) if you finish all the food. That's a good model.

I have this scented oil which will be helpful for your weight loss Regular exercise + home cooked food is the best way to go. Indians are thin because most don't know jack about nutrition.

Employees randomly packing orders wherever they want. No proper fans or lighting. \n\nOther suspicious things like selling tandoori chicken and shawarma when both of equipment clearly hasn't been used for some time.\n\nThey used to have hot tandoor baking fresh chicken one side and fresh shawarma on another throughout the day.\n\nNow they probably just make it in bulk, then heat it up whenever ordered.\n\nI also noticed a dip in proper manner/courtesy. Dine in customers are probably no longer their primary customers and they treat you like that. \n\nThen there is also the repulsive business model of companies involved.\n\nHonestly someone should start a trend of \"This hotel/restaurants does not take orders from Swiggy/Zomato\" places.

    "comment" : " That may be true but did anyone notice quality of Swiggy plummeting down. New delivery boys who don't even know how to use the app navigation and rude behaviour. Nothing ever happens even if you complain so they just keep getting ruder every month. You regular the wrong places I guess. The places I regular are still fine except that service takes a bit longer than usual as online orders get priority. But since I mostly am out with my family I do not mind. \n\nI have a couple of places near me who do not take orders from swiggy/ zomato. they are good too, but take a similar time in serving. Again the delay does not bug me, so alls good. They are getting paid 50-60 bucks(30% commission + 30-50% discount + returns, cancellation and scams) for a 200 rs tandoori chicken by the swamato due to the competition, fomo and monopoly in the market. Dude always remember that if you are eating out or ordering food you are eating extremely unhygienic food. My friend who is now chef at third restaurant has seen some shit. He never eats out. No matter from where you order. Shit has got the fan since order delivery services came. Because customer is not even at restaurant to see if quality of kitchen is up to standard or not. That was just a one time experience for me. There's a pizza outlet where I went to. The times when I had food at their place, It was amazing. When I ordered through swiggy, it sucked badly Not sure about dining in, but I have definitively noticed a dip in quality in the food since zomato/swiggy have become mainstream.\n\nEarlier, all the curries used to have their unique flavor and taste. Now it feels like they just have one big tub of curry and they just add the stuff you've ordered. So mushroom masala tastes EXACTLY the same as Butter Paneer masala, just with Paneer instead of Mushroom. \n\nEven the most premium restaurant available on these platforms in my area has same tasting food whenever you order. It's slowly getting so annoying that my lazy ass rather prefer to cook my food myself Looks like Swiggy/Uber bullshit has hit both the restaurant business and the delivery business equally well. \n\n1. A friend got his food delivered in a la carte style : A Swiggy delivery executive shows up, puts his hand into the cloth bag which the restaurant gave, proceeds to hand my friend the items that were in it and leaves with the cloth bag.\n\n2. Uber executive calls my friend, tells her that he cannot find her house because his GPRS(?) is not working. She helps him navigate, and while at it, he runs out of petrol. At this point, he is 200m away from her place. He keeps saying random stuff and pretends as though he is not understanding where he is. He refuses to ask the people passing by, for help. At the end he abuses her and asks here to come to him to get the food. Uber refused to refund her the money, stating the reason as \"unable to contact the customer\". Yeah. Remember going to a Punjabi restaurant in Bandra since 2007. Visited there this year after a gap of four years and it has actually way worse off than before. Food seemed hastily cooked and the waiters just literally wanted you the eat and gtfo and there was a line of delivery guys outside. [deleted] The good restaurants I like don't do online delivery in the first place That is true .. reason behind is earlier, business was simple .. the raw material and prepration cost was needed to be calculated with price to get an idea of decent profit .. now swiggy etc take away nearly 28 %  off per order so they have to adjust the quality and quantity to maintain the same profit.   Eventually they apply same formula all across.   Basically what they're doing is scrapping off the gone 28% from regular direct customers .. so quality has been degraded all over ..",

    "comment" : " From my experience I can talk about Italy.\n\nItalian food focuses on fresh and high quality ingredients. A lot of dishes are created with few and relatively simple ingredients. Some things that are commonly eaten: Salad with only olive oil and balsamic vinegar or even bread with olive oil and salt. If you can do it with extra virgin olive oil, even better.\n\nThe food in general in Italy is amazing where ever you go, every region has its own version of the same dish. You have to get used to it though. At the beginning it might seem bland, but slowly you start tasting individual ingredients and it gets better then.\n\nIndian restaurants here are not so good. So every time I feel like eating something spicy I eat a pizza/pasta with nduja (spicy pork) or just manage to cook something at home. US - I've been to Texas. The local food here is mostly Tex-Mex or Mexican and it isn't really far off from Indian spicy food. The other american food suggested by the people were mostly what you consider junk food here - pizza, burgers. Then there are english breakfast stuff - bacon, sausage, pancakes etc. In my two weeks there, I did not go to any Indian restaurants or homes of any Indians and I didn't miss the Indian food at all. In fact, it felt like I was in India but eating only restaurant food and non Indian cuisine.  \n  \nUK - Again 2 weeks in London. The breakfast options are the same as what you get here, but apart from that it's all fish and chips. Every other english food item (except dessert) I tried was plain bland. But London being a big city and all options available, I tried other cuisines and so I could manage. Also, pizza and burgers are readily available. I didn't go to any Indian places though. If I had to go to some small town where there aren't any Indian/Asian/Mexican restaurants, it would've been a struggle. Fish and chips would be available, but the fish is like boiled fish.  Also, london is expensive as fuck. Never going there again unless someone else pays my bills. Recently ate Singaporean stuff like laksa along with some Japanese stuff.its tolerable but yeah your spice intake will be reduced compared to Indian ones. Indonesian food is also very rich in spices. Even the fried rice is excellent. Try googling for Nasi Gudeg, Egg Balado, Sate with peanut sauce, Soto Ayam, Ikam Bakar Kecap Manis. Usually they also serve sambals, which are kind if like chutneys, but I like them more. I stead of pappadums, they have krupuk, of which krupuk udang( shrimp crackers) is my favourite. A good Kang Kung hitokaye or some capcay make good vegetables. Generally, Indonesian food is great, but the dessert scene is still lacking compared to India. \n\nVietnamese Pho is something I truly enjoy. It has all the delicacy of Ramen, with less salt and more lemongrass. I liked it the moment I smelled it. \n\nAmerican food was honestly a bit disappointing for me. Most of it was just uncooked salad or grilled steaks, hamburgers etc. or stuff like Mac n Cheese which I dislike. Food from Louisiana, especially Cajun and Creole dishes were very enjoyable though. I suspect there is a lot left I haven’t experienced. \n\nCaribbean food is delicious, but a bit limited in range. It can be just as spicy as Indian food, but it feels more wholesome. Jerk chicken is a dream. Food from South America, especially tacos and burritos and salsa were also to my taste, and they are very popular in the US. Cuban food is great. I wish our lentil curries tasted that good. \n\nBritish food was disappointing. Fish n Chips were ok at best. Generally I found they dishes from the rest of Europe was commonly found in the UK. Hungarian Goulash tasted good. The Brits are fairly good at baked desserts though, especially cakes and puddings. Sticky toffee pudding is good. \n\nI dislike almost all Chinese food I have tried save a few Sichuan dishes, mainly Mapo Tofu, Twice cooked pork, meatballs, cooked duck and some dim sum. Honestly the smell itself is sometimes a problem. Maybe, as you ask, if I tried going to China, I might change my opinion. I went to US an tried their food.It's not  with spices like ours. I can describe it as raw. Most westerners eat their food raw. The sweets are pretty good.  If you go to the restaurants you will be surprised as you pay lot of money for little food. At the end of the day there's nothing good as our own Indian style Living in US and been to Italy, France, Belgium and Netherlands.\n\nUS: You get everything here, by everything I dont mean Indian. I mean it taste wise. If you open up to eating all sorts of meats, then you have ample choice of good spicy cuisines. Mexican and Thai food can surprise you with the kind of spices they used, they are super hot (In US Hot is Teekha not garam). \n\nItaly: They know how to use spices, but not salt, if you add a little bit of salt to the dishes you are fine and I loved the food. Especially try their coastal food its Yum!\n\nFrance: I only liked the bakery items, not that the food is bad, but ordering the right thing may take some efforts as they are not very friendly with English. However I must agree they use a very little to no exotic spices. Blant very blant food. \n\nBelgium: Again since they have a heavy influence of France, there food is similar but they have some good dishes which an Indian would love for the spices (again need to be open for many meat choices ).\n\nNetherlands: Lovely culture and food and you can easily love their food being from any part of the planet. Burgers, sandwiches and salads mainly but super tasty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I would say is  open up to all the choices, food is food ! And there are passionate people making it, keep your beliefs aside and try it! Canada -\n\nThere is plenty of Indian food here, Toronto has a huge Indian population and you will be easily accommodated. Even in smaller cities, there are still plenty of Immigrants pretty much wherever you go. Man, get out of your comfort zone. I presume you are still in your 20s. This is the best time to move around. Once you are married there are a bunch load of problems moving around. Why don't you go aboard? Apply for a Phd or something?\n\nI find it extremely depressing that there are people who have not got out of their city or their state.",

    "comment" : " Dad had diabetes. What helped him was exercise. One hour of exercise everyday. Do add that to the list. I have a slightly different question. My dad(and his sister and his dad) has diabetes(Type 2, detected after 45). My mom doesn't have diabetes but her mother(my grandma) had it. Therefore, my genes are full of diabetic dispositions. How do I minimize my chances of getting afflicted with diabetes? The amount of misinformation spread in this thread regarding diabetes amazes me. Please don't treat diabetes as a causal condition. It is indeed life altering. If you are in big city, get a diet chart from dietitian. I'm in the same boat basically. My mom and dad both had diabetes and I'm on a high risk as well. \n\nWell I'll tell you some stuff. This advice goes to anyone looking to live a healthy lifestyle and avoiding diabetes.\n\n1) Do Intermittent fasting. Watch Dr Eric Berg's videos on YouTube on that topic. Basically what you wanna do is keep the insulin levels as low as possible to avoid being insulin resistant which leads to diabetes. Plus IF has numerous benefits.\n\n2) Exercise is the best medicine. Doesn't matter what kind. No brainer.\n\n3) Sugar is evil, I don't eat even a tiny bit. Sugar doesn't mean only sugary stuff it also means things high in carbs/glucose (rice). Search about glycemic index and why it's important. So eat right. Search ketogenic diet.\n\n4) Keeping stress levels low, stress is related to all kinds of illnesses. \n\n5) Related to point number 1, don't eat too frequently in a day. Every time you eat you spike up your insulin levels and it's bad if your insulin spikes regularly causing insulin resistance so try eating twice a day. I eat twice a day once at 12pm and at 8pm followed by 16 hours of fasting. I've lost most of my belly fat, corrected my insulin resistance and I haven't felt so much better in a long time, all my symptoms of pre diabetes are gone. \n\n\nIntermittent fasting doesn't mean that you're 'fasting'. You can still eat any amount of food you want but only in a given time window. \n\nResearch about these things and good luck! r/desiketo My father was diagnosed with diabetes at age 46 and exercise was the miracle cure for him. His diabetes was still in early stages when I made him join a gym and quit all sugary/junk food. In 6 months his sugar levels went from 600 to 90 and that level's been consistent even after 2 years. I guess what helped him the most was that we started early and didn't let it get worse. \n\nEven tho his sugar levels are not high anymore, we still don't allow him sugar. For tea he only drinks green tea or black tea, we don't add too much ghee or butter to his diet because of high carbs, no more junk food and regular exercise. Altho you need to find what works the best for your father because everyone's different. Check out intermittent fasting. I've read it can reverse even type 2 diabetes.\n\nGoogle about it and read more on its sub - r/intermittentfasting My father had diabetes since his early 40s and was able to keep it under control till his legs began to trouble him in his late 70s. He walked for 45mins every day whether it rained or it was freezing. Also he followed a strict diet of no sugar, no potatoes and very small amount of rice. Exercise and diet control is only help.

This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets\n\n2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.\n\n3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.\n\nNow, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers. More on that [here](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-rejigs-gold-service-to-benefit-restaurants-ceo-1566402560626.html)\n\nYesterday, Zomato Co-founder and CEO engaged in below the belt fights and said they were done with this campaign.\n\nSo, who do you think is right in their stand?\n\nEdit: My apologies I wont be able to reply anyone on here since I've been banned, but thanks for having the convo!",

    "comment" : " When Zomato Gold was introduced, participating restaurants were told it would be an exclusive platform for a select few to grow their footfall. In about 6 months that changed and now any Tom, Dick & Harry can sign up. They also changed the rules for customers who signed up for unlimited unlocks, but are now limited to 1 a day. Amidst this fiasco, they've also increased the membership price of Gold by 50%.\n\nZomato charges the merchant 20k per annum, and the customer 1,800 per annum in return for what? For a separate list in the app and minor tweaks where you get a Gold logo. No part of the kitty is given to the merchant, who is paying Zomato to join what used to be an exclusive club _and_ giving away freebies.\n\nIMHO one of the real scoundrels here that's getting away is Swiggy. Swiggy has been running discount campaigns for several months in India under the moniker \"Swiggy It\". The customer gets a 30-60% discount on every order, for which the restaurant is charged a flat fee. What customers don't realise is that the flat fee is often times more than the discount that they're receiving. Let me give you an example:\n\nI run a cloud kitchen that was offering a 20% discount on all orders with no max discount (aka discount cap). So if a customer ordered worth 1k, they'd receive a discount of Rs 200 and both parties were happy since the order value went up proportionately to the discount.\n\nThen came their predatory \"swiggyit\" campaign, where my restaurant had to pay Rs 87 + tax for the customer to get a discount worth (upto) Rs 100. The tax is now being paid because Swiggy has positioned the discount as a \"growth pack\" and restaurants are technically purchasing a product from Swiggy for every order. So 87 + 18% GST is about Rs 103. And at the end of it, the customer's discount is capped at Rs 100, and many times he doesn't even receive the full cap value of the discount because it's a percentage of the order total.\n\nThe real clincher is that an order would have to be worth Rs 500 if the customer was to receive a discount of Rs 100 under our old promotion. Instead, now the customer gets a lower discount and we get charged more for every single order than the customer will ever receive in discount value.\n\nOh, and Swiggy can claim the 18% GST in input tax credit whereas restaurants can't.\n\nIf you don't sign up for this discount campaign, you get pushed so far down in the listings that nobody will ever see you, seriously maiming visibility and discoverability.\n\nFor anyone defending Zomato or Swiggy or UberEats, I invite you to try running a restaurant. In fact, try running even a delivery kitchen, which involves lesser startup costs, operational overheads, and is overall a leaner outfit. It's not as easy as it looks from the outside. If restros cant shy away from pricing a humble neebupani at 150, paratha at 100+. I stand with zomato. \"Food doesn't have a religion. It is a *business*.\" Schemes like Zomato Gold were never going to be sustainable in a low trust society like India Amazon is coming Bois... Who does Zomato Gold and Infinity and other things benefit?  \n  \n- Users - Discounts. More food for lesser money.  \n  \n- Zomato - Money from users, commission from the restaurants per order  \n  \n- Restaurants - More customers, but losses per customer per order.   \n  \nWhat am I missing? If nothing, there's no reason why Restaurants should be on/with zomato. Related link:\nhttps://theprint.in/economy/how-zomato-went-from-food-industry-fairytale-to-evil-corporation/279592/ i remember posting a big post here almost everyone thought i was overreacting today how the tables have turned \n\nso lets analyze whats wrong \n\n1) ***deep discounts*** of which the restaurant bares 35-40 percent and the company the rest the problem is if you order worth 300 and give a discount of even 30 percent the restaurant pays 90 rupees and the company caps the discount at 90 so they didn't end up paying the rest of the percentage the customer would not care if he didnt get the 10 rupppes lesser since he already got 90 rupees off \n\n***2) no self delivery-*** the company no longer allows self delivery the percentage charged for my outlet is 17 because i signed it a while ago today they dont wanna take on anyone for lesser than 30 percent per order . At least let us deliver our food so that our commissions can be less \n\n***3)zom gold*** \\- recently a friend took us to a pub and for 4 beers we payed 600 which is ridiculous had i bought it from the wine shop it would have cost me 500 how will you as a person run your pub on 100 rupees ? im not mentioning the sign up fees etc \n\n***4) bad service -*** never in all these years did we face a problem of delivery boys eating the customers food . even when a order is cancelled i never receive  my food back . account managers not answering calls going on random vacations and the service center is just abysmal \n\n&#x200B;\n\noverall zomato needs to behave I personally think this is a healthy campaign. The Food Aggregator Apps are still at a nascent stage. And we all know how startups can be aggressive for them to be to be successful. So right now, they are probably bullying the restaurants. And now these restaurant associations have woken up and fighting back. This is nothing but market forces at play. Soon, the market would mature and all the stakeholders would reach a point of understanding where everyone gets benefited. These are natural events in a free market and let's not paint someone bad or good here.",

Every decent railway station has a waiting room with toilet and bath. Most tourist places also have Sulabh with toilets and baths but cleanliness varies.\n\nMost places outside railway and bus stations have very cheap food options. Make sure to walk a little outside as those inside and adjoining are bit costly due to location. Focus on heavy filling food like Chole Bhature, Rajma Chawal, dal roti, parathe or whatever local cuisine is available from stalls not dhabas. Any food joint with a place to sit is costly compared to movable stalls. Pack food and water when traveling to touristy places as its quite costly there.\n\nSince you will be walking and traveling in local transport, dont worry about healthy food.

    "flair" : "Food", 
    "comment" : " I seem to be the only one who isn't puzzled by how exactly will the population of cats increase when stray dogs are taken care of. It's not like they have a direct competition for resources/survival. In a Pune (Pimpri) apartment recently, a stray dog bit a little girl's leg who soon died instantly on the spot. The girl's father started a campaign to remove stray dogs from the area and I don't think his is wrong. Such incidents are becoming quite common in big cities but I'm yet to hear a stray cat attacking anyone yet. First of all, there's no proof that toxoplasmosis is a \"mind control disease\", there are some studies going on which link toxoplasmosis to certain mental illnesses, but nothing has been proved yet. TP is mostly asymptotic, but can develop seriousl conditions in people with impaired immunity like HIV, as you mentioned. Wikipedia says almost 50% of world's population carry the parasite. So, if indeed it was a \"mind controlling parasite\", then we can very well conclude that the toxoplasmosis parasite is basically running the world!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, \"removing\" dogs/cats is never the option, the best method is population control by neutering/spaying. But this is expensive and that's why municipal corporations are loathe to spend the money when they can just cull the animals. A lot of people and NGOs end up doing this out of their own pockets. My girlfriend personally pays for neutering and treating all her neighborhood dogs & also raises funds in the college where she teaches to look after the dogs that reside in the college premises. I sometimes help her out with this, and believe me it is not an easy job for common people to do! One of her college dogs had got distemper and had to be put down. Then we had to go an disinfect the whole college premises and vaccinate every stray dog there. Without municipal help, the costs are often too exorbitant to do what we want to do. But still a lot of people try. There's a guy we know who runs his own NGO to look after stray dogs. He takes in any disable dogs he comes across and looks after them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, just like humans all animals are unpredictable and can have fits of rage or mood swings, we need to respect all of them. When I was a child, I used to be very scared of dogs, I would try and avoid streets where I knew stray dogs loiter. In my attempts to steer clear of them, I often tried to run away and ended up being chased!! But as I grew up, I learned to treat them with respect as I would do a human, and as a result I have become more friendly towards them, and they towards me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a classmate long time back who was attacked by her own pet dog who had developed some kind of a disease. Her dog bit her in the face and left her disfigured for life, but this did not affect her love for animals at all. She told me that she was still sad and cried after her pet dog was put down due to the disease. I don't think stray dog population and stray cat population is related in that way, you seem to assume that they are negatively correlated, but like you said, dogs are more compassionate, they don't really kill much, certainly not stray cats which can be ferocious, removing stray dogs or not, there will be little impact on stray cats.\n\nHaving stray dog is indeed a problem, so is having stray cats, don't think of excuses to avoid solving a problem, like I can't say congested cities should not develop metro systems because constructing metro systems is costly and without metro systems people can also ride bikes which is a healthier lifestyle. Just spay and neuter them, and let them be We can just sterlize dogs to control their population because frankly speaking their population is out of control and in the neighbourhood they bark at random people, sometimes even bite kids, etc so something needs to be done. [deleted] As someone who's very affectionate towards animals and also recognises the fact that population explosion leads to problems, I'd say both animals have different challenges and I don't know who's better or worse.\n\nDogs are much more affectionate and understanding towards humans in general but they are a greater challenge in terms of threat from attacks and rabies. They are much more dangerous when in packs.\n\nCats are comparatively shy and even difficult to spot. Cat bites and attacks are significantly lesser. However my colony has had a cat explosion lately because of which I know their issues. They have the habit of pooping outside people's homes. As you mentioned, they don't recognize boundaries. Cleaning that is a task in itself and they don't even get deterred away easily. Second, they reproduce much faster. A cat can give birth to 12 kittens in an year. >Cats hunt arbitrarily.\n\nNot true.  Wild or semi-wild animals hunt for food only.  What is your source for this statement?\n\n\n> They also carry rabies and the mind-control disease Toxoplasmosis(fatal with HIV). \n\nNot limited to stray cats.  What is your source for this statement?\n \n\n> Cats have no understanding of boundaries \n\nThis is an absurd statement. Cats are territorial and their territory can be large.  No animal has the \"human\" concept for boundaries. What is your source for this statement?\n\nI like both cats and dogs.  Please don't let your admitted liking for dogs color your thinking.

Have you guys got any so far for? \n\nHere's what I've been thinking: \n\n\\-- chopping up onions and grinding them to a paste and freezing them into cubes\n\n\\-- make some gravy bases in bulk - i.e. I love the mughlai so I'm planning to make this and then freezing them into cubes and storing\n\n\\-- readymade upma mixes that you just add water to and heat in microwave for 3-5 mins\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys have some tips & tricks that you use to make healthy, tasty food?",

    "comment" : " Instead of puréed onions, freeze onions that have been browned. Makes things quicker as frying onions is the longest part of most curry bases. You can also freeze chopped herbs in a bit of oil in ice-cube trays to make anything taste fresh. Also boil daals and freeze in portions. All you need to do is a tadka and reheat. Invest in a rice cooker. 10 minutes for fresh rice and you don't have to tend to it. You can also make pulao by sauteing onions and spices and chucking it in the rice cooker with the rice. Just don't put peas or beans in till the end. I don't think you're saving a lot of prep by freezing chopped uncooked onions. You can get one of those onion chopper things to save time chopping onions. Not Indian food but it helps me save time:\n 3-4 scoops of oats + 3spoons boutnvita initially and blend.\n\n Then add 1/4th cup milk blend. \n\nAdd peanut butter and banana (+nutella if not heath conscious) blend. \n\nAdd 3/4th milk blend.\n\n Breakfast ready in less than 2 minutes. >freezing them into cubes\n\nHow do you do that? r/MealPrepSunday",

She always talks about wanting her own source of income like starting a small canteen or getting a job or something like that. \n\nMy father quit his job a few years ago and earns a 50k pension. He is trying to setup some business and has blown all his savings on it and has huge debts from some relatives including me. He is also a major self-centered prick who doesn't seem to care too much about my mom and always discourages her...which btw I think is one of the biggest reasons why my mom wants to earn for her own.\n\nI have already suggested her to get started with some English classes because she'll probably have a lot more options once she's fluent in it. Do you guys have any idea how I can help her get some income for herself?

Let her attend some classes and learn the skills.\n\nHome cooked food. Depending on the location and logistics, she can earn well. If she is good with cooking , ask her to join Tin men. It's a new startup in Hyderabad which does delivery of home made food.\n\nYou just have to put all types of food she prepares. Users can order on daily basis or monthly basis.\n\nIt's just like Zomato or Uber eats but instead of delivering food from hotels and restaurants they deliver food from home.\n\nIn Hyderabad lots of people use Tin men and subscribe food on monthly basis, so it could help her make some money. Hyderabad - Food sells easily. Location in Hyderabad? also post on /r/hyderabad Learning English will be a good skill, but don't think that will land her a job. In her age it's better to play your strengths rather than learning something new,  which let's face it, every damn graduate has done and is better than her. Why would anyone hire a 48 year old woman when they can hire a fresh face 20-21 year old?\n\nAs others have stated cooking food is the best way she can get income out of something she has been doing for decades. It's great that you have a start-up available in the city that specifically caters to that niche. Help her get some equipment that will cut down on the prep time. She can get started in no time.\n\nBear in mind there are no free lunches, people have to work hard to get money, if there were jobs which paid good and could be done in the comfort of people's own homes with little to no investment of time or labour, then every one would be doing it. IMO, food is a good low-risk business and also builds you a loyal network of clients who may be interested in any future ventures. \n\n[https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/food/bm-saveur-chapati-mane/articleshow/21173894.cms](https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/food/bm-saveur-chapati-mane/articleshow/21173894.cms)\n\nThese people started from one house in Blore and now do good business from 2-3 outlets around the city. However, it is a time investment if it becomes too successful. TINMEN - Home cooked food just register in the website , they will come and take the food from your home and deliver it to customers . There might be alternative apps like this too . I know only TinMen Find your District Industries Centre, they have classes for skill & entrepreneurship development, usually for free. Google Meesho app. Insurance Agent: I've heard they make super money from commissions.   \nmany of them start as Post Office investment agent. very small commissions there, but you get a nice clientele.  and then widen the scope to LIC agent.  gradually can open MF distributor / agency too.   \n\nhave you given a thought about them divorcing ?  \nthat way. your Mom can get some good chunk of money & half of Dad's pension too. Depends on where she lives there could be multiple opportunities with Self help groups. A small store is also not a bad idea if you have the money to set up a small shop. \n\nDepending on how desperately does she need money and investment you can put up see below a list: \n\n1. Cooking for others (home meals, cloud kitchen) \n2. Self Help Groups\n3. If she learns some English and if she is bilingual in a regional language (except Hindi), she can translate the Market Research for various research companies. \n4. Kirana stores, dairy store etc.",

It isn't that harmful , just maintain a proper workout routine and sleep table. i did only nights for a year, did only cause it was a 14 hour shift per day and 3 days a week working. Although i didnt mind it in the beginning it did take a significant toll on my health, i wont advise prolonged periods of it. This was back in 2009-2010 When you're awake, everyone you know would be sleeping and vice versa. Days would be bright and noisy and could give you sleeping troubles. It would/might be difficult for you to form a routine with respect to your eating habits and the likes. Your social life becomes non existent. Definitely not good for your mental health.  \n  \nPhysically, you should mostly be okay because the body needs n number of hours of rest every day and that could be done in day time too. But you might miss out on vitamin D and endorphins. There are other ways to get this though. There's a book called why we sleep. Read it don't keep this up long-term.. but for short-term, think of it like going abroad and experiecing jet-lag. It takes a few days for body to adjust to new time-zone. Our body changes circadian rhythms based on signals that are in-turn based on eyes receiving sunlight.\n\nsimulate lighting and sound levels and trick your body into thinking it's night. Escpecially sound. I'd advice those [screw-like silicone ear plugs](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJiT0bs3aEXyWteWfkHiyC5Ye1slELLrNYHf8GG_6KK4-nrm16).  You will have soundless sleep. Alarm clock sound penetrates through though. They cost around Rs.100. You can get them in medical shops. Depends from person to person, I've had no side effects from doing night shift for the last 3 years. No loss of sleep, or tiredness. But I do have colleagues who get a lot of issues. It's only possible if you fully commit to the night shift. Don't try to do stuff during the day. Eat breakfast foods after waking up and dinner after getting back home. \n\nEven small things like keeping your room dark and quiet help a lot. Get thick blackout curtains and use earplugs if there is unavoidable noise.\n\nEdit: also maintain your sleep timings, don't change sleep schedules on weekends and holidays. Melatonin is a great sleep aid that I use when jetlagged, it really helps me - may be worth trying it out. I used to live with a guy in Pune who works night shift at a company in Hinjewadi. He is 5’8” and weighed about 50kg’s. At times I actually thought he’d die",

It has happened twice with me while riding uber that I was overcharged because their gps showed a different route than the one that was taken by the driver.

This will be much more meaningful and satisfying than giving money. \n\nMy mother always chides me for not giving to charity. I strictly won't give my hard earned money if I cannot see its effect on the ground. Instead I choose to give my time to causes that I like e.g. beach clean-up, volunteering in schools etc. Why not sponsor the education of kids of some economically backward people from your own locality??

Less than half the donation actually reaches the intended target, most of the money is spent on operating expenses and advertisements and events etc. Better to find people in need of aid in your locality and give them the food and clothes and stuff. [People archive of rural India](https://ruralindiaonline.org/pages/donate), their work about covering the news across Rural India is incredible No charity will utilize 100% of the donation to direct charity.All charities have inherent management costs which can go as high as 50% in some cases.This is the cost of office,vehicle,labor,marketing , ads for more funds and man hours expended.Some may even put it aside as a rainy day fund.\n\nYou want to utilize 100% fund utilization for charity then its better to do it by your own hand.If someone else's time is involved, then that time has a cost factor associated with it I donate to [UNICEF](https://www.donatetounicef.in), the amount is deduced from my account monthly and goes towards the care of premature birth babies. SOS children I don't have the details off the top off my head, but my family finances some schools in Uttarakhand and UP.\n\nYou could look into finding schools which need help.",

    "comment" : " It is just a colloquial way of saying to stay hydrated. Let's not make everything an issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDehydration is a common thing during summers. Hence they say foods to cool down. \n\nAdditionally, we also observe eating spicy or acidic foods and toxic foods, exposure to the sun for long times lead to boils, or heat rashes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the foods recommended to cool down are meant to cool down or are less acidic (like yogurt/ lassi and all)in nature to balance diet. Ayurveda is based on superficial observations and correlations. In fact, there is no need to single out Ayurveda. All pre-scientific ethno-medicines are arbitrary. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani (Greek) are based on very basic (often wrong) observations. And our language has not been purged off some badly chosen terms either. For example, the term 'boil'. Why is a skin boil called boil? These common sense terms hinder our understanding.\n\nAnd these systems did not know about the perception tricks played by brain. Mint 'feels' cold on the tongue because the molecules unlock receptors that are supposed to detect low temperature. Spicy food 'feels' hot and causes sweating because brain is fooled by capsaicin unlocking high-temperature receptors.\n\nSome observations, however, still hold true even when their models were wrong.\n\nFor example, a shaman using some leaf paste along with elaborate rituals and dancing to cure malarial fever will be successful. His model might be wrong but he will succeed nonetheless. Only problem is the shaman cannot know which parts of his cure are worthless and which is the active part actually doing the treatment.\n\nOr system which attributes disease like tuberculosis to a spirit and recommends quarantine will be right despite having a wrong model. (spirit rather than micro-organisms)\n\nAyurveda is the same. It's based on a bad foundation. Naturally, (pun unintended), it will have wrong diagnoses and wrong treatments. And it doesn't help that it's not revised thanks to our taboo of updating ancient wisdom. Food-induced thermogenesis. Different foods have different calorific values. Some foods take more calories to digest and others don’t so the sum total or calories or heat they add to you is positive or negative. None of this can change the fact that you seem to be a jackass. Just like other bullshits such as positive energy and negative energy.. Try beef and see the difference in your body temperature. IMO it's not about body heat but about how the foods make you feel, mostly in the gastrointestinal tract. Eating a lot spicy food has the opposite effect of eating a lot of curd rice for example and it's not far fetched to associate those feelings with heat and cold respectively. Other foods can be categorised in the same way. It’s Ayurveda. \n\nIt’s bullshit anyway. If it's annoying you then why listen? Just do whatever you like Honest opinion, if I eat chicken or certain foods, I do get constipated(even though I ensure I have enough fiber) and limbs are heated.\n\n\nI have been informed it is that the nature of my body is heat and rather consume it in low amounts. This is personal experience.\n\n\nFor ex : I require cooler AC when compared to other family members. I tolerate winters better but summers are hell.\n\n\nHope I get to see a good discussion. Good question though. It's easy to understand, certain food take more energy(heat) to digest than others and it matters during scorching summer",

They were extremely dirty and the doctor doesn't do the surgery over there but the doctors \"helper/dog catcher\" did the surgery, I saw this first hand. \n\nAlso in one small cage three dogs were forced to live with not enough place for them to lie down with their feces and food intermingling in the cage, that is what little food they are given. This led to infections post surgery. \n\nI have also been told that they sell the medication being given to them by SDMC for dogs in the open market.

She said the stray dogs continuously bark and don’t let people enter the colony.\n\nHow cruel! No one expects you to feed them but just how absolutely inhumane do you have to be to PREVENT others from doing so? I wonder if she would be okay with her kid going hungry for days? I bet she is obese and couldn't go an hour without stuffing her face full of oily snacks.\n\nIf dogs are fed and loved, they are not aggressive. They're barking because they're hungry and frustrated.

    "comment" : " There's two ways to address your question/rant/whatever: a point-by-point refutation, and a big picture refutation. Let me try a bit of both.\n\nBig picture: you need to understand our history to fully understand the scale of crises we've already dealt with. Separatist violence - Kashmir, Punjab, North East, Naxalism, Maoism, severe (real) food shortage - we used to depend on imported foodgrains before the green revolution made us self-sufficient, immense ignorance and illiteracy - we had 15% literacy in 1940s, and a paper-thin govt. Even as late as 2000s, we had endemic power shortage leading to long cuts even in summers. These problems were solved and now the country is self-sufficient in power generation, and most power sector issues are DISCOM-specific (economically).\n\nNow we're a 3T economy, with 75% literacy rate, 600 billion dollars available for the central and state govts. to spend in tax revenue, a growing economy - exact rate of which is disputed but 5-6% is a number we can agree on.\n\nHalf the issues you raised are trivial/moot.\n\n> The rate at which water is wasted\n\nTo an extent fixable, as our local bodies get their shit together. When on the brink of crisis, people find ways to solve problems. The tanker mafia crisis in metros is actually a boon because it provides economic incentives for conservation - people are installing unit-level IoT water meters in apartment buildings, recycling for flushing etc. and so on.\n\n> The food might run out due to the surge in population\n\nBalderdash. Our food production issues were solved during Green Revolution. No country with a GDP/capita of $2000 and growing is starving, and is rich enough to import foodgrains if a massive catastrophe impacts production temporarily for a couple of years. For every suicide you see in papers, there are 10 farmers making a living, not a luxurious living - sure, but can feed themselves and their families.\n\nThe surge in population bit is BS. Our population growth is slowing down, TFR is down to 2.3 which is very close to the replacement rate. If you can feed 1.3B today, you can handle 1.33B the next year and so on. At 1.6B or so our population will stabilize, and we'll finally be at a stage where the number of people is not outstripping the amount of roads/railways we build.\n\nWorldwide, there's a glut of agricultural produce.\n\n> Air pollution due to unchecked emissions\n\nEvery country goes through a phase of unchecked industrial growth, which is contained as those issues hit crisis levels. If you go back a hundred years you'll read similar stories about Thames or Sienne.\n\n> Religious, racial and political issues\n\nWe had bigger religious/political/racial issues 50 years back, and law enforcement was poorer, and people were less educated. A handful of cases in backward districts are blown up by the 24x7 media.\n\nThe average Hindu might not be a fan of the average Muslim, but he has no problems buying goods or services from him. It leads to gentrification, but not religious violence.\n\n> Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities\n\nYes, our economic growth is very unequally distributed. You can leave your 20LPA job in Bangalore and get 5 offers in a week, but in a tier-3 town you'd be hard pressed to find a 3LPA job. To an extent cities like Pune and Hyderabad are taking off, but it's still too less.\n\n> Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs.\n\nUnkill-ish hand-waving. There are plenty of problems with govt, but they are also facing ever-increasing scrutiny, with public pressure to create complaint handling mechanisms, and expectations of time-bound handling of complaints. The situation is far better with central govt. employees, and state govts. could do a lot better.\n\n-------------\n\nTL;DR is that yes, we'll face hetherto unforeseen livability challenges over the next 15 years. In this time frame, we'll also start transitioning to a clean energy economy, planned urban spaces, stronger pollution enforcement and so on. All problems are solvable as you become richer, and there's no indication that we won't continue on the path of economic growth - we might slip to 5% from 9%, but the growth engine will keep on chugging along.\n\nEdit: thank you, kind anon, for the gold :)\n\nEdit 2: interesting quote I found from Norman Borlaug's wiki:\n\n_Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, \"The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\" Ehrlich said, \"I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,\" and \"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.\"_ it already sucks. takes me 45 mins to cover mere 5 kms. huge waste of time and fuel. Liveable if you got ₹₹₹. I would like to remind people that India has gone through pretty shitty times during the last couple of centuries. Just go through the major catastrophes that befell us. Famines, the world wars, the partition massacres, crushing poverty, widespread riots, wars with neighbors, violent secession movements, etc.\n\nIt's true, this time too it's going to be difficult. These threats that you outline might unravel our society.\n\nBut then again, they might not. I have faith in the fundamental goodness of the country and its people. These threats might well cause us to rise above our narrow differences and bond together as fellow humans. I saw a hint of this during the last floods in Kerala, when people came together to help each other. I am sure that a common enemy will force us to rediscover our shared humanity once again. Paili fursat me nikalna h I have strong opinions on climate change, so please bear with me.\n\nI think climate change is going to disrupt everything in the next decade. Every week, there is some news about it. We read it, feel helpless and move on with our lives. Then turn around and blame it on the politicians and others. Sometimes we also act and make small changes in our lifestyle; stop using plastic bags, save water, etc.\n\nHowever, nobody really knows what's in store for us. We get warnings every other week. This is the hottest month, the civilization is ending in 2050, the insects all dying, the corals being bleached, food chain is collapsing, etc. At some point, you just stop paying attention. What can we do, after all. These problems are so big and intractable, right?\n\nWrong. We can do something; [plant trees](https://www.livescience.com/65880-planting-trees-fights-climate-change.html). Trees are the only way we can save our planet. We all fondly remember our childhood and trees played a central role in it. I used to climb up the trees in my backyard and pluck the fruits. I haven't done that in decades. Where has our love for trees gone?\n\nWe need to rediscover our love for trees. Only then can we save the planet. I just need some way to get out of here. I'll become a taxi driver if that's what it takes. Yes, it may not seem like it but things are actually getting better. \n\nOn the water front, our home in Bangalore had a borewell (just like everyone else), but with the adoption of rainwater harvesting and the arrival of Kaveri water, we use the borewell a lot less than before. We've noticed that the water table level has risen. As more people adopt these measures, the water shortage will improve.\n\nOn the traffic front, more public transport (like Metro) is being adopted in more cities. (Unbelievably, Lucknow has a metro now!) Overall, this will take years (maybe decades) to build out but it will definitely resolve some of the traffic issues.\n\nAlso, with good metro, high-speed rail etc. in combination with village electrification and running water, the pressure to move to cities like Bangalore will reduce. And then as seccond and third tier cities like Mysore or Mandya being to acquire modern amenities, some businesses will relocate there further reducing the pressure on the big cities.\n\nAlso, there was a research paper studying the impact of global warming on the Indian monsoon which found that it is going to result in the subcontinent getting 10% more rain. (If you're surprised by this, don't be. Warmer air can hold more moisture in it and the south west monsoon gets its moisture from the Indian Ocean, which is not going to run out of water.) This is a huge amount of extra water which will actually be good for our country. Of course, the possibility of floods and cyclones increases with global warming, but as last year's cyclone Foni showed, these are manageable problems if competent people are in charge.\n\nNow, all this will take decades to have an impact on your immediate situation, but in the long run, we are on the right path. The most immediate problem is the water, while others will not make India uninhabitable in the short term. The government needs to sort out the water crisis. Some of the responses above highlighted most of the key issues. I work as a researcher and practitioner in the area of urbanisation, specifically in the areas of mobility, water and sanitation and governance. My reply therefore might not add any value or could be  terribly narrow and blinkered, so do bear with me. \n\nIndian cities, like those in other parts of the developing world, are exploding in terms of their population growth. Urbanisation at this rate is unprecedented in human history, so even though we might know potential solutions, the scale that we need to cover is mindboggling.\n\nUnfortunately, our governments do not have the financial or human resources to structure and order this process. Therefore, while we have good policies and legislations for the most part, governments are not in a position to enforce them. Take the case of water supply in Bangalore. Pumping water from a distance of 100 kms and an elevation of 300 metres, BWSSB manages a world class system in bringing water to the doorsteps of Bangalore, spending tens of thousands of crores.  However, once it reaches the city, the horrible distribution network within the city means that lakhs of households are not connected to this network. The old pipelines also cause leakage and leads to 45% of this water to be considered as 'wasted'. Fixing the whole network would costs hundreds of thousands of crores, if we had the capacity to do it. So we don't. For politicians, they've managed to bring water for residents, so they continue to get elected. For bureaucrats, they've acheieved the same, so they continue to work in the same manner, pushing for low-hanging fruits rather than engage in structural reform. \n\nWe citizens also contribute significantly to it, ignoring and avoiding any roadblocks that reduces our comfort. We flout building norms, traffic rules and labor laws because we know the state doesn't have the capacity to enforce the law. So whoever can afford to, digs borewells to ensure that they have a coping mechanism. However, even after knowing of water scarcity, we don't change our lifestyles to adapt to these new conditions. We still want to wash our cars daily or leave the shower running because it suits us. We don't want to install rainwater harvesting systems because we don't want to spend money. \n\nRight now, society as a whole is continuing on its business as usual path. The problem is that resources are running out and climate change will exacerbate all of our existing problems. Water is going to be undoubtedly the largest. Some studies have pointed out that by 2025, Bangalore would be unlivable due to the lack of water. The situation is pretty much the same in most other parts of the country as a casual scan of the news for the past 3-4 months should confirm. \n\nCan this be reversed? Possibly. But we don't seem to want to do it. As time goes on, it becomes more and more harder and expensive to get there as well. Unfortunately, given the humungous inequality in our society, it means that the privileged will be able to access technology and government support to continue in the same fashion. The poor will suffer. We as a country are just managing to improve upon our modest baseline in making the lives of the citizen better, climate change will definitely push it back down. Life expectancy and incomes will reduce for the poor, while expenses for healthcare will drastically increase. \n\nWhen people's lives are not getting any better, social divisions tend to widen. Violence as a whole might increase, especially in areas with little policing along the lines of gender, religion, region, caste and class. However, this is something that the State and the political class like to manage/control, so rather than an anarchic society, we may see an apathetic State which condones violence. \n\nThe answer to issues like air pollution and water scarcity has been around for ages, we've only done what we could do to postpone dealing with the question. For air pollution, it's getting people off their vehicles and on to public transport. People reply (and legitimately so) that there is no public transport system. Governments say that they don't have the money to buy buses, although they spend an order of magnitude more on building flyovers and expressways (which only incentivise people to use their vehicles more). It becomes just another vicious cycle. \n\nUnless all of us come back and take a serious look at the social contract that we have and our roles within it, I think that we're all screwed. Water scarcity will be unbearable, heat and cold waves will kill off an increasing number and violence will possibly increase drastically. Food production might remain stable, but given the changes in rainfall patterns and our agricultural style, I might be being optimistic. The State will continue to function as it currently does, trying to make the best of a terrible hand. \nYou and I and everyone else here will possibly continue to live a similar life. We're the elites. The above points are very much valid day by day the quality of life is degrading. Only the rich are immune to this as they dont spend much time on the ground and usually are away.",

One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit\n\nHis entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: \n\n\"Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.\"\n\nAlso he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read \"Our moon has blood clots\" I foresee the situation to worsen in Kashmir while it will get better in Jammu and Ladakh. This will predominantly be because of separatists and other locals who might have been rendered slightly powerless. There is a reason why PM sent more armed forces into the state.\nAs for my return, i can list out a few reasons why i do not want to return:\n1. Highly volatile atmosphere with frequent disruptions due to militancy, army. \n2. Not many opportunities work wise\n3. Presence of radical islamists and separatists in the valley makes me believe that it’s very easy for 1990 to repeat itself . There is a reason why extra army is present in Kashmir at the moment\n4. sold off the only house we had in Srinagar for peanuts after finally giving up the idea of returning. Some of my cousins’ houses were burnt down or squatters simply moved in. In short, there is no neighborhood I can think of returning to.\n5. Younger cousins and the generation after has grown up outside of Kashmir with only language or food binding them to Kashmir. No point thrusting them into this chaos. \n\nYour question #4 does not make sense at all. How can you quantify someone’s loss that too after 30 years? Keep in mind, people did not only lose house or property, but whole lives were uprooted. The community has nearly lost its identity outside of JK and will essentially be non existent with in next 50 -100 years. Can you put a $ figure on it?\n\nI am also not sure what reservations are you referring to in question #5. Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  \nI will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :\n\n\"I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch.\" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:\n\nMy parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. \n\nUnfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of \"patriotism\" and \"unification\" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. \n\nThe most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here.",

    "comment" : " Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.\n\n> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](\nhttps://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) \n\n> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. \n\n> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. \n\n> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.\n\n> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai\n\n> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.\n\n\nThere is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?\n\nb. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?\n\nc. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..\n\n1. Which module(s) were you part of?\n\n2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?\n\n3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?\n\n4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?\n\n5. What was your preferred method for DFT?\n\n6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?\n\n7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?\n\n8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.\n\nThanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this?",

Very cool and epic Would there be a chance to ask our questions prior to the start? Time constraints here make it hard to be online at that time. okay that's nice. Do kejriwal next please noice! well done mods Great job mods. Here are two of my questions in case I don't make it online then:\n\n1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?\n\n2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Wow. Amazing.\n\nRemindMe! 14 hours  My questions to Atishi:\n\n1. AAP has done wonderful work in primary education. What is your vision for professional and higher education?\n2. In view of the looming threat of AI taking over most lower level jobs in about a decade, what is your vision for education which will make students employable in the future? Why is the Marlena last name suddenly getting dropped everywhere? This is GRAND!",

And how much time did it take to become a master in trading? Is it your full time job?\n\n3. Also do you have some insider information that us plebs can't even fathom? Finally! \n\nI'm a CA student and have maintained a decent portfolio. I have a few (many) questions for you. 😊😊\n\n1. What reading material would you suggest to a young **investor** to get a grip of trading?\n2. I once lost 10k in an intra day trade. Haven't dared to trade again. How to get out of the fear?\n3. How to get a good grasp of trading in futures?\n4. Do you use algo trading? If yes, how did you learn to code and what books have you read to be good at algo trading?\n5. How do you maintain your cool when you incur a big loss on a bad day? \n6. Can you tell us more about your daily lifestyle? Your routine etc. Seems like you beat u/risingsteam 's allegation from the last year post that you were just a lucky orangutun.\n\n> \"I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\n\n  \n\n\n> Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\n\n  \n\n\n> Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.\n\n  \n\n\n> By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on “How I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet, they’ll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\n\n  \n\n\n> By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same — 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips.\" Kudos on crossing 1cr on trading. I have a couple of questions for you.\n\n1. What got you into trading in the first place. Any insight into your background?\n\n2. What was the learning curve involved.\nHow did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. \n\n1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?\n2. How many days of the year you work in one year?\n3. How many hours you spend per day? How much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? So that one can live off the profits and doesn't need to do other jobs to earn a living. What’s your basic strategy - Momentum trading , special situations ? Also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio. \n\nCongrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it ! Congratulations. wow! do you recommend any book a beginner can get. 1. Do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? \n2. Whats your average trade size? Like, how many RIL shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?\n3. which sectors are your favourite? I burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock",

Do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? Hah 3 months is rich, took.me 6 to even get a job..... \n\nHold tight man , it will come. Did you take education loan, if yes then how much, if no then what was your total kharcha for the MBA? As someone who is doing a job after BBA and is stuck between doing Papa ka business or making a career by myself. Is MBA worth the 20-30L of investment? I am 33 year old planning to do 1 year MBA from IIM A/B/C/L or XLRI. I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. \n\nReason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.\n\nShould I do MBA ? \n\nKeep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you're earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn't that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It's been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you're also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn't last too much though).  \n   \nBtw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?\nI may be able to refer you if something matches.",

Failure after failure after failure It's really quite amusing how he mentions that he is an IIT Alumni and CEO... Look man, we are all supportive of new startups but you gotta learn humbleness and how to sell an idea.\n\n Putting your background info on display instead of features and USP of product clearly shows that you lack confidence in your own product. Grade A chutiya. \n\nA genuine AMA would have been great for his company but no, this guy HAS to try (and fail miserably) to be a smart ass.\n\nGuess cheating in exams (and life)is a life long trait.\n\nEdit: For those who don't know, he or his minions created fake accounts to plant questions. As expected, he was caught and called out. It's a cringe fest out there.  https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9duvkq/i_am_ceo_of_drona_aviation_startup_of_nanodrone/e5ku49n/\n\n> Commenter: When will the machines rise up?\n\n> AMA IIT CEO: I am not sure. But I sure hope to live to see that day.\n\n> Commenter: Oh shit you’re a super villian aren’t you\n\n> AMA IIT CEO: Still in a nascent stage. One major tragedy required to convert me into a full fledged super villain.\n\nWas this AMA enough, guy? LOL! How do you if someone is from IIT? They tell you in the first sentence lol. Wow... it is very interesting to see people commenting on my AMA in an entirely separate group. I am that CEO from the AMA.  \n\n\nOf the many things said here, people have criticized the \"waving of IIT tag\". There were two reasons for that:  \n1. People don't trust that we can build good products out of India and they necessarily have to come from US / China / other countries. We hope to change that by bringing a product from India to the world.  \n2. This product was designed in labs of IIT Bombay. This is our way of giving the due credit to the institute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould we have worded it better? Absolutely. What was good however was that people asked some very relevant questions about drones globally, drones in India and industry in general and I really enjoyed answering them.  \n\n\nI appreciate this thread and the AMA, especially because:  \n1. It showed us how passionate people are on Reddit  \n2. Good learning on what mistakes to avoid on the platform. failing how ? anyone here into drones? can you recommend me one?",

There shouldn’t be any taboo since we are all spending money for company, in one way or another  One of my earlier rejection stories:\n\nAfter finishing engineering, I had to be at home for almost 2.5 years before I got the offer letter. Almost everyone who got hired with me, had their jobs delayed. (This was like 15 years back).\n\nAnyways, I was really excited about the job and I was in training where I saw this beautiful lady in the same class. I had this instant crush, but no balls to walk up to her to talk. I did not really know it was called as 'dating', but you would just ask them for coffee at CCD and it meant that only. Or you would write a letter and give them. \n\nSo, training was for 3 months and 2.5 months had already passed. Once training is done, you can be posted anywhere. Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. \n\nAt that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said 'excuse me'. Which she didn't hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn't know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. \n\nThat's it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.\n\ncan share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I'm just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What's the point of having an AMA if you don't answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It's ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There's two options you got:\n\n1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. \n2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). \n\nThe second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. \n\nBuilding great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. \n\nAnd learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

You can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/)\n\nIt was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life. People started off slightly aggressive, with downvotes and sarcasm, but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas, \"Sharma jee ka beta\" mentality, newspaper liners in drawers, and swapping music and movies.\n\nI'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.\n\nHamari zubaan ek hai, rang ek hai, libas ek hai, aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay. Just because you say dibba and I say dabba doesn't mean we can't get along.\n\nI just wanted to ask my Indian dost how you guys feel about what's happening, and wondering if there's anything the people - you and I - can do to make things better?\n\n**This is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance. Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.**\n\nPlease talk to me, and tell me your points of view.\n\nLove you guys!\n\nDhanyawaad!",

    "comment" : " It warms my heart to see your kind message.\n\nPeople from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate. This doesn't mean that either side becomes a doormat. Definitely not. But I find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation. The loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for.\n\nI think it is important for us Indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every Pakistani. That most of the people of Pakistan condemn the act. For this, it would help if Pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too. \n\nIt will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities. A lot of the distrust is out of ignorance, out of just not knowing better. It is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasn't done genuine harm. People have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness, more truth can fix this. \n\nMost importantly, I would like to mention is that I'm Indian and we say dabba at home. I did not go through the previous AMA so if it was acknowledged that some Indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again. \n\nEdit: I realize I haven't asked a question here but I am looking to discuss ways to control the situation. Also I did want to ask about how it's portrayed by Pakistani news but someone already did.  Im scared. I have no clue how any of this is going to play out, I hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but I'm honestly worried I Might get drafted.maybe I'm paranoid, but we're talking about a possible nuclear war. What scares me most is how Indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes. I don't understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country. Yeah sure it was terror camps, but we shouldn't celebrate that. We should do it with reluctance. War is the last refuge of the incompetent. It shouldn't be worshipped. I was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said \"main sone chali neend mein thode Pakistani maarne hai\" \n\nI was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young ( I'm 19 she's 18 ) can have some much hatred. I get the anger that Pakistan **might** house terrorists and it's a matter of concern for both of the countries. Later on I ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picture.\n\nBut I see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country. It makes me feel sad. \n\nI'm grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hate.\n\nI've seen enough documentaries and talked to enough American war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is. I'd never wish Something like this upon any of the countries.\n\nI just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost. \n\nThank you for your efforts. Peace.  Elections are coming, they will end and so will all the chaos. day by day I am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other. I am not in FB as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each other’s blood. war is a lose lose situation for both the countries, hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again. Whatever this is, this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on Indian soil through terror camps based out of Pakistan. It is a show of power, and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming. The only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country. Indian jets have crossed Pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only.  \n\nThis show of force isn't going to do anything because in the end the ISI/Military will be do what they have always done, send terrorists in with their blessings. Your governments have always been a puppet of the ISI. The utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten, nor will they ever forget. And Kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it. In the end, the citizens will suffer. Both sides of the border. And jingoism will continue. In the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best, and veg biriyani should be nuked.  [removed] Politics, attacks etc. may happen, but there is no need to hate a common Pakistani citizen staying in Lahore or Karachi who is busy minding his own job. I know we have these issues. They need to be solved mutually. Till then, you guys keep on producing music. We are producing our movies. Out of our hands really. Morons outnumber on both sides.  Welcome bhai.\n\nOur leaders need sense.  There's absolutely no need for people to die.  Not Indian, not Pakistani.  At the end of the day we're all in this big messy world together.  This is so unnecessary.\n\nYes, love you guys too..\nAn Indian. Hi, can you help me understand why some Pakistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp. \n\nNo civilian was harmed & no armyman was killed, so why the hate ?\n\nand I have to say this, India & Pakistan is temporary, Chicken Biryani is forever.",

People who are so used to scripted interviews can barely make good of AMAs. I am not a big tv watcher. So far I thought Arnab is that guy who just shouts on TV but atleast he seems to be a guy with strong moral values and guts to speak his mind.\n\nReading that AMA I felt the complete opposite. He came across like that soft spoken neighbour hood aunty that won't stop nagging  you until you eat her \"worlds best sambhar\". Also how she avoids every other question yet somehow manage to mention about her sambar in every line.  Has anyone compiled a list of the 'pearls of wisdom' given to us by Arnab?\n\nLike:\n\n['Freedom for a reporter is in his mind.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgte6gk/)\n\n['There can never be enough nationalism. More the better.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdmwg/)\n\n['All Indians should be pro military and pro India.

My takeaway: It is easy to ask tough questions to people and very difficult to answer them.\n\nThat's clear from the answers of a person who made a career out of asking tough questions. /u/thatscoopquestion\n\n4 hour old account, posted (at the time of writing) 3 soft, simple questions, Arnab answered them all in succession. Am I being paranoid? Seemed like he hired someone off internshala to do the AMA on his behalf and just gave them the direction \"REPUBLIC IS THE BEST AND UNBIASED. K? BYE.\"\n A man who claims to do hard hitting journalism cant handle straight questions . I don't think he is quite sharp . He said to an answer that everyone shall be pro-military - that something you expect from an 19 year old who hasn't read much history or politics .\n\nI like army as an institution but am i pro-military nopes that looks like a path to blindness to me    Cringefest Just like Newshour was.",

So a warm thanks for putting it for free on YouTube.  It was a great film, but you could tell their access stopped once kejriwal became CM. However, as a viewer, that's the point I really wanted to get an inside look into AAP - it was after coming to power that they lost a few of their morals, and started kicking out smart people like Yogendra.\n\nEverything they covered till that point is sort of, in the public domain. We already knew that stuff - the film just gave a more human look at things. I hope they aren't selective in choosing which questions to answer What's your perception on Kejriwal base on your 1-1 interaction with him during the shoot? How different he really is than what is portrayed by the media? AAP died once Yogendra left.

Hey Swati, loving the attitude, you did walk in to an AMA which could've been all guns on you, you did excellent.\n\nAs a two time startup guy who managed to get acquired (fairly happy) both the times - touchwood-, I'd like to know where do you see CK going? A possible exit by acquisition? \n\nAdditionally, what drives bigger business motifs for you - niche ecommerce or mass multi vendor? \n\nI was also consulting one of the biggest coupons startups a few years back, and thought they would be far bigger now - but they couldn't innovate at the rate at which they should have (still one of the biggest..hint hint..elephant :P ), lack of innovation and burning to build a quasi loyalty program does end up draining most of the money out of the system for some players in the similar space. \n\nr/India doing me a prod as well by maintaining decorum.  This feels like a good AMA by reading all the answers. So how's your normal day like Swati?  Yes, I have read them. Both Amazon and Flipkart are well aware of our business model.. we work with their teams directly and in fact they tell us about all their upcoming promotions in advance, even buy extra advertisement space. They don't like us giving Cashback as real cash hence, you will see on CashKaro that we offer CashKaro Rewards for Amazon and Flipkart shooping - these can be withdrawn as Amazon/Flipkart Gift Vouchers rather than NEFT transfer. So there is no issue really.. they may not work with every Cashback site but they do work with us in a legitimate manner. \n\nhttps://cashkaro.com/stores/flipkart\nhttps://cashkaro.com/stores/amazon (in fact Amazon informs us every month which categories are allowed for Cashback - these change every month)  \nTotal staff strength? Why should someone use CashKaro and not other Cashback websites? (Other websites have better UI and similar offers IMO) On a scale of KRK to SRK this is Tiger Shroff 😂 Do you sell customer data? Isn't cashback industry too dependent on online retailers? What if tomorrow Flipkart and Amazon starts to provide cashback directly to consumers like Paytm? Do you think they don't already do so because it is not a profitable business practice? In the AMA announcement there was a comment which suggested that CashKaro had not followed through on the rebate for the person. How often does this happen? Do you track this as the CEO? What are you doing to prevent it?\n\nLooking at your Facebook page, the top 2-3 reviews are from former interns or current employees. Are you comfortable with what that insinuates about your business? Hi swati , thanks for doing AMA\n\nDo you think little app is your competitor? Its catching up these days in restaurant , saloon deals.",

I will close the AMA tomorrow noon, please ask anything you'd like, I don't mind answering it as long as it is not very personal.

The Vir Das ama he promised is still pending. \n\n\n**Edit**: Explanation for /u/nitrozipp3r, /u/Lurkingtwerker, /u/tintin_007, /u/USpolitics2017, /u/TheComingOfTheGeeks on Imran Khan and /r/India:\n\n[Actor Imran Khan did an AMA here 3 years ago (Wow).](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/236bpy/hi_reddit_longtime_lurker_first_time_poster_imran/). Apparently he had been using Reddit India for a long time with an anonymous account that no one knew. People enjoyed his AMA and he put himself forward as someone who was different from other Bollywood people and was willing to criticize it. This earned him a lot of fans here and he started commenting regularly on his AMA account.\n\n His comments got a lot of attention and people were acting starstruck, commenting with awe on his every word. Eventually some people began to dislike him and call him a hypocrite e.g. posting pictures of him on set with a poor servant following him around with an umbrella etc. \n\n\nAround this time, Priyanka Chopra did an AMA on /r/IAMA. /r/India was mad because she paid money to have a road named after Her deceased father. There were some legitimate criticisms but also a lot of irrelevant and cruel comments. The AMA was a disaster. Imran Khan later said that he would ask Vir Das to do an AMA. He posts the screenshot of a text where he asks Vir Das to come over.\n\nHis account suddenly disappears after a few days. \n\n**The commonly accepted theory:** He voted on a linked thread. This is a reddit taboo and gets you banned. I disagree because there's no source for this claim. How would someone else know that he vote brigade? \n\n\n**What I think**: A guy asked him whether he will name a road after his newborn daughter like Priyanka Chopra did for her dead father. IMO this was the final straw for him from his growing number of critics here and he deleted his account.\n\nHe probably still comments here from an anonymous account but this is one of the great mysteries of /r/India. If anyone has more info on this, please comment. \n\nAlso, it looks like I'm an /r/India veteran now. Damn.  I am going to message him on FB asking for an AMA. :) 1. Identify topic most vocal section of social media passionate about\n2. Go with the bandwagon\n3. Publicity. Good try Abhay Deol! [removed] AMA with him will be great. Good idea. Upvoting for visibility  One man does virtue signalling - and we MUST speak to him. Have you guys never heard of a public relations campaign? ",

Considering how taboo sex is in Indian culture, how were the reactions of your family and friends when you decided to work with sex workers? Hi. Congratulations on the success of Avahan!\n\nMy question is - \nMost of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who’re young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? \n\nAlso, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!\nThanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.\nIf you have more questions ...well read the book :)\n\nBye Here is a recent [article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/13/the-untold-story-of-how-india-sex-workers-prevented-an-aids-epidemic-ashok-alexander-a-stranger-truth) in the Guardian about the journey what leadership havr you seen come up due to your efforts? My book is not so much about HIV and many of the  questions are …\nIts about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that\n\nIts also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...\n\nits about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..\n\ni'd welcome questions on those lines too... I’ve heard from my friends who’re at MBBs that it’s not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions -- \n\n> Hi Ashok! First of all, a big Thank You. People like you who tirelessly work towards betterment of downtrodden and society at large are the real (unsung) heroes.\n>     \n> 1. What are your thoughts around BMGF hiring consulting cos for \"projects\"?\n>     \n> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.\n\nHow would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.\n\nAlso are there any CSR projects that are looking into this?",

I have a -3D eye prescription (after lasik but) correctable using glasses. Would I still qualify?\n2. I'm 29 so by the time I complete training + 2000 hours I might be 31 or 32. Is it too late already?\n3. Is it easier to find a job internationally? I make about €7000 a month but with a job in Emirates or likes of it, I might make about €8000 or more with the cost of an abnormal work schedule?\n4. Also, is it worth it financially? I think I might spend €100k to receive a slight bump on my salary.\n5. How is the work life balance? I know pilots work in shifts but on an average do they work more than 40 hours a week or less?",

Yay! Here we go! \n\n1. There seems to be complete radio silence on the Nag program ever since Ajai reported [target acquisition issues](http://ajaishukla.blogspot.com/2012/07/indian-army-and-drdo-co-operate-to.html) in 2012. Is the missile ever going into production, or is it effectively dead?\n\n2. Some news outlets report that the MiG-29K has been a rather poor performer, and that the Navy isn't very happy with it. They say the avionics don't perform as well as advertised, the structure was found to be too weak for repeated carrier landings, and then there was also the CAG report that pointed to atrocious serviceability levels. What's your take? Is this all true or exaggerated?\n\n3. You have been asked to bet the ungodly sum of [Rs. 100](http://imgur.com/W7ATlMi) on the outcome of the single engine fighter competition. Which one would you bet on, and why?\n\n4. If there was one (or a dozen) glaring, commonly-held misconception about the Indian military that you'd love to dispel, what would it be? \n\n\nAnd some questions from /u/IndoAryaVII, who couldn't attend.\n\n> * In this article, he goes on about: https://www.livefistdefence.com/2017/02/exclusive-indias-5th-gen-amca-targets-2030.html - this:\n\n>     >\"‘If you consider that the LCA Mk.1 will be built till 2024 and the LCA Mk.2, when ordered, should be built between 2030-35, then 2035 is good target for production of the AMCA,’ Balaji says.\"\n\n>     Should it be rather “built between 2025-2035” rather than “2030-2035”? I find it difficult to believe there would be a 5 year gap between Mk1A production ceasing and Mk2 production starting as well as Mk2 development taking 13+ years.\n\n> * And ask him if he has any info on the Tejas Mk2, any spec info at all?\n\n> * And the last 2 questions being, how is the Kaveri-French tie up going along and how is the MII Rafale deal going along? This was great! Thanks for this first AMA. We'll do more soon. Thanks for the questions, folks, and see you soon!\n\n-- Shiv From /u/seb-aur-santare:\n\nHow would you deal with Kashmir if given the chance? What do you think are the big changes in Indian defence policy since NDA? Hello Shiv.  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Why would you feel you are qualified to write about defence? Do you have a defence background?  what is the reason for  really  large import inventory  for defence equipment ? are indian  defence manufacturing totally bust ? \n\nrecently their was chatter about ammunition selection? any takes from your side. Why is there so much resistance to induct Tejas and Arjun? Are yardsticks being shifted constantly or are there are genuine problems in the two platforms?  1. what do you think are some crucial defence programs under development for India's future?\n\n2. do you think India already has the capability for MIRV, but is kept under rug? if no, how far are we from having it? if yes, why is it kept a secret?\n\n3. how successful do you  think India's Anti Ballistic Missile program is? will it be successful in real situations? What are your views on Aadhaar with regards to security on the digital frontier?  Via /u/chipsnmilk\n\n>* Thank him for covering the an32 Missing incident when noone else did.

    "comment" : " a stupid question:\n\nhow is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:\n\n1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to \"customise\" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?\n2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?\n3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?\n4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?\n\n\n2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.\n\n\n3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?\n\n4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,\nAs someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.\nWe have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) \n\nAlso someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.\n\nAnyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad. \n\nSuggestion - Improve the collection of preset activities \n What is the motivation behind this project? Also, how did you get your first paying customers? [deleted] [deleted] Do you consider [Please.com](https://Please.com) as your competitors? Any job openings? ",

Wasn't a good experience but won't blame it totally on them. \nI think in this business model, only flaw is that the user gets the cashback 2-3 months after the transaction(which is still not sure, like 40% of the times, it gets denied) \nIt's a good model but sadly it'll never be scalable to a large audience.   So, reddit is promoting a bunch of highly educated scammers. Nice. FUCK. She doesn't have a wikipedia page. > Swati Bhargava is the Co-founder of CashKaro.com - India’s largest Cashback & Coupons site\n\nPretty sure coupondunia and mydala are bigger The comments tell me this AMA gon be gooood. This is weak From the comments, it looks like the AMA will be a shitshow and as such I totally expect it to either get canceled or poorly answered. \n\nI rarely see AMAs on r/india, so to see an AMA like this one surprises me. Mods need to give more details how they chose this to be hosted. Is this a promotion?",

    "comment" : " Hello.\nIt's good to see an Indian MP doing something like an AMA.\nI would like to ask you what your personal opinion is about SC/ST reservations in political, professional and educational institutions. \nDo you think they still have any relevance, or has the time for them passed, and they are just being misused now? Do you think parties should reveal all data related to their funding? Thank you for this AMA, sir.\n\n1. I read your [insightful article](http://tathagatasatpathy.com/web/Epidemic.aspx) about the spread of Jaundice in Orissa. There has been much research that uses mobile phone cameras to detect Jaundice, and many apps for doing this have been developed in western countries (predominantly for detecting Jaundice in infants). Some of us would like to work with the health ministry to develop these for India. How can we reach out to them?\n1. Do you think that the short-term social ills that can arise from deregulation (like agitation among farmers and tribals) are worth it for the potential long-term benefits? To this end, what are your views on the Land Acquisition Bill?\n1. The GDP of Mumbai is more than the GDP of the entire state of Orissa. Orissa has much untapped economic potential (tourism, food processing and manufacturing). Yet, governments in the state have not focused on significant pro-growth reforms - regardless of political affiliation. Why do you think that is the case?\n\nAgain, thank you very much for doing this AMA. I hope your example is followed by more legislators in the country. Hi, I am from your constituency. I live in Caltex square area. \n\nI wanted to ask that [last year the government announced a special job fair](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Students-in-a-fix-over-deferred-dates-for-job-fair-many-cancel-reservations/articleshow/42330062.cms) for unemployed technical and management graduates. 100 INR was collected from each interested student. About 3 lakh students registered as of final count. But, the job fair never took place. Can you tell us what happened to the money?\n What is your party's take on Cannabis decriminalization?  How do you balance editing 2 newspapers and being an MP? How different is the 16th Lok Sabha when compared to 14th and 15th? Better or worse in terms of efficiency of getting bills passed, the general behavior and attitude? Hello Sir,\nAn article on front page of New Indian express says despite spending crores the state continues to be in the grip of dreaded malaria. Odisha tops the country in incidence of malaria (36% of the whole country). Odisha is also third in terms of malaria deaths. How is the state government going to tackle this problem?\n\nBJD had walked out of the Lok Sabha when  Land Acquisition Bill was passed. Specific to Odisha what are the issues BJD finds in the bill ?\n\nNaveen Patnaik had written to PM to re-examine coal block earmarking process. Again specific to Odisha what issues BJD finds in the coal auction process ? Hello Mr.Sathpathy it is great to have you with us. \n\nI will come straight to the point. So here are my questions:-\n\nQ1 Last November you spoke about Black Money and said \"Governance and Government do not change according to the political party\" Is this also applicable to your party i.e. BJD which is in the Government in Odisha?\n\nQ2 In 2014 General Elections Narendra Modi's juggernaut swept almost the entire country but not Odisha. Their BJD won 20 out of 21 LS seats. How did your party manage that? \n\nQ3. When you were speaking on Land Acquisition act you said \" Nation wants to know\". A MP behind you was quick to point out the journalist with whom this phrase is associated. How often does such funny incidents happen in the house?\n\nQ4 What will be your advice for young people like me who want to come into politics? \n\nQ5 and last question When are we going to see a BJP-BJD alliance again? :P >So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india[6] community. \n\nGlad to hear that Sir. This is a special opportunity for many of us (one that we might not get later on, so I know that I wish to juice as much info/views i can get out of you).\n\n----\n\nYou've been the representative for Dhenkanal for the last 11 years.\n\n* 2014: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal\n* 2009: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal\n* 2004: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal\n\n**1)** What according to you have you done in the past 11 years for your constituency? And what have you done for the rest? (Please provide sources if u can)\n\n----\n\n**2)** In India atleast, LS RS proceedings tend to be a noisy situation where many politicians engage in hooliganism. Most practically scream at the top of their lungs, disregarding everything anybody has to say. There are many other incidences that just sounds pathetic. IMO (In my opinion) and I'm pretty sure many agree with me on this, It feels pretty sad to see something like this happening. I assume its supposed to show that the politicians are fighting hard for the people they represent, but to many (even if they support our own beliefs) it just looks like the politicians are shutting down every other other views. LS and RS are places where each of the points are supposed to be thoroughly vetted and debated. Screaming helps no one (IMO). Similar to parties walking out. I know its part of tactics where a certain group wants show protest, but not want to disturb political deals. Why can't they have a separate flag that just say they should not be counted while still listening to all sides of the story and participating in the debate instead of walking out on every thing? **What are your views about this?**\n\n----\n\n**3)** What are the challenges that you have faced (not political parties) that have impeded you in your efforts?\n\n----\n\n**4)** If you could create a law that would be implemented (that isn't already), what would that be?\n\n----\n\n**5)** How long do you think will it take for debates raging online to have a VERY sizeable impact in real life politics.\n\n----\n\n**6)** What are your views on the bad Maoist situation in Orissa? Do you feel sections of the proper Indian Military (not CRPF), and Air force needs to be brought in to deal with the Maoist problems?\n\n----\n\n**7)** How would you rate the practices taken by the Orissa government to boost Industries and Industrial growth?\n\n----\n\n**8)** Who do you think acts like an Idiot the most in the LS (in terms of impeding the processes of the LS)\n\n----\n\n**9)** How do you think that being the editor of your own newspaper has helped you in your personal and political endeavours.\n\n----\n\n**10)** Call out some of the bad practices of BJD, or acts that you don't like/support.\n\n----\n**11)** Personal question: I've identified myself as a gamer (computer gamer) when i was younger. I still do (but not professionally now due to familial pressure). We see tournaments such as the DOTA2 international which gives out prize money of about (67 crores ->in comparison IPL prize pool was about 25 crores), and many other such for a large number of games. The chances of earning good amounts of money in playing computer & console games on a competitive level is far higher than in most other sports, with a very large audience. And even in case we can't make it to the big league, streaming pays a lot of money. Yet everyone from the government at best does not do much to stop them and at worst erects barrier after barrier to stop people from playing. This is in addition to the bad rep that gaming already has. Many other countries have started organizations to help its citizens in their ordeals - (Especially in terms of procurement of visa etc) Korea, malaysia, China, Canada, America (in the process of creating one). Why hasn't our government even recognized it as a sport?\n\n----\n\n**12)** India is considered as one of the most trigger happy countries in terms of censorship. What are your opinions about that and also in terms of privacy concerns being raised.\n\n----\n\n**13)** How much do you think India is able to handle the American NSA and other such organizations that want to snoop on our (confidential government data + normal everyday data of its citizens) by their projects like PRISM etc.?\n\n----\n\n**14)** What is the question that you assumed  you'd most probably have to face, right before doing this? \n\n----\n\n**15)**lastly what are your views about memes on the internet and on portals like whatsapp including ones that are probably based on you?\n\n----\n\n***Please answer what you can. Thanks. And Please don't skip the entire thing if you don't want to answer a few of them*** 1) What is the cause of widespread poverty in Odisha even when it is fairly rich in natural resources ?\n\n2) What were other reasons behind BJD-BJP split apart from what was shown in news ?\n\n3) How do you manage to win in a large state like Odisha ? Family name or actual ground work. If latter, any examples ?\n\n4) Are there any people in BJD who want to expand outside Odisha or wish a new BJD-BJP alliance or with any other party ? What is party's official stand ?\n\n5) Compared to rest of CMs, ~~Biju~~ Naveen keeps a low profile and we rarely hear anything about Odisha apart from natural calamities. Reason ? ",

    "flair" : "AMA", 
    "comment" : " Can we please put the pitchforks aside and actually ask straightforward tough questions? This is the need of the hour. The world would be watching this.  Can we please go with some alternatives as a community so it helps drive home the point? It was wrong for FB to call this program 'Internet', its not Internet. It was wrong that they said 'some internet is better than no internet'. It was wrong that it was exclusive for 'signed up' participants only. We got past that already. Its not about NetNeutrality anymore. \n\n\n1. Assuming the platform is open to all, Zero rating in principle is not wrong. What we allow to be zero rated is what matters. We can have support forums, dev communities, documentation/help/faqs and such pages zero rated. Not the main marketing site of the product or the core business website. For a SaaS, its easy to make that call, all logged in pages goes off the zero-rating. For a hosted/in-premises technology solution, it means marketing website is off zero-rating. Facebook's main website will never make that cut. Whatsapp will never make that cut. So does wikipedia. Govt services that are informational will be allowed but service based ones will NOT be allowed.\n\n2. Second option for FB to get the next billion users online is to buy raw bandwidth for them so they can waste/use it any which way they please. They can target specific parts of India, like rural areas and be benevolent about it. Lets not try to fool people with 'it is expensive'. People who have dealt with ISPs for bandwidth know exactly what they mean. \n\n\nGoing with one-track-mind of 'all zero rating is wrong or bad' OR its against NeutralNet will not help us get faster to Internet for all - with the right price attached.  Dear Mr. Daniels, I've highlighted my questions below *in italics*. \n\n**Question 1:** *How much money has been put into marketing your internet.org platform?* In-app notifications, polls, windows and sponsored FB posts count as marketing. *How much of it was dedicated to the actual product development?* If Facebook stands to make no profit from this venture, why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development? \n\n**Question 2:** If (big if) the motive was 100% charity, *what other ways were considered as worthy of charity?* Example: Microsoft's former CEO launched the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world. Why would Zuck and other stakeholders not just do the same? Do you really think a farmer in Maharashtra can benefit more from joining Facebook groups than having access to high-yielding crop, equipment, and infrastructure? \n\n**Question 3:** *What are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users don't fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did?* Are there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and time-wasters? What's to say that they won't just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments? We both know that's happened many times in the past, and the fact that you're planning to introduce a largely un-initiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks. *By how much has Facebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassment?*\n\n**Question 4:** Please take a few minutes to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM) and respond to concerns raised therein. Looking forward to *your side of the story on why VOIP was omitted*. Please feel free to *respond to other critical points* mentioned in that video too.\n\n\n**Feedback:** Your marketing for internet.org has been atrocious. Calling people who do not subscribe to your world view 'lobbyists' is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you. That's how children argue! The whole over-aggressive, dare I say immature, marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs. \n\nI appreciate your attention. Please take the time to do an AMA for more than an hour. This is a complicated and critical conversation, arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our POVs. After all, having more and better communication is the point of the Internet (.org or otherwise). \n\nI look forward to an extended, insightful conversation with you and the Reddit India community.\n\nThanks again! Is there any mechanism by which the mods can restrict this AMA to only those members whose handles are at least a week old? Knowing Facebook and the crap they pull, they are not above brigading the thread. Maybe we should \"accidentally\" call some international net neutrality activists in this AMA? Oh boy. Dayum! Now thats unexpected. Throwing himself (and his PR team) into randians' natural environment.... They've got courage at the very least. :/ May I bring my gandassa please?  This is a huge one. We all need to ask the right questions, and not indulge in shitpostery. Expecting new accounts to pop out of nowhere for the AMA. Won't be surprised if most questions go unanswered",

Already had tumour. Doctor says that if you take tension anymore (which I am taking, because of my relationships and mental health issues), you will either get a stroke or partial/full memory loss.\n\nDont know how much time is left, as I have completely lost it - faith, believe system and hope and most importantly my comprehension ability.\n\nI have done pretty good in my life till now and was one of the 1.5 lpm guy! \n\nWanted to do few things before I completely dissappear - first online and then offline. Ask me anything. Roast if you want. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara! ",

Bhai theek ho jaoge chill karo 🙌🏻\nGet well soon ❤️ [deleted] we're all going where you are, any last words/advice you'd like to give the to us who are slowly dying?  If you come to Delhi, meet me please! I'd love to have a cup of coffee and try to understand how you are dealing with this. My problems are nothing compared to yours.  Rula diya bhai. \n\nWishing you the best. 😘\n\nDo update us when you have  conquered all this, which you are definitely going to do! \n\nGood luck. \n Hugs. I am so sorry!\n\nWhat were some best moments in your life?\n\nAlso, when was your first diagnosis?  bro , knowing when you will die is a gift which not many will have in their life. So make amends and don't forget to live RIGHT NOW. This reminds me of munnabhai mbbs movie actor jimmy shergil.\n\nAnyway. Stay strong. Have fun.

That nose in quantico put me off her for the rest of my life.\n\nand the cleavage exhibition dragged me right back in. Her accent is soo cringe. Something about her annoys the hell out of me. London Real youtube channel is really great: great long interviews of excellent people. Must watch. Ma ki lodi Don't know why would people complaim about her accent. Just look at her face, how can you think about accent ? [removed] Is she? Can she do an AMA here again?  channel is full of her videos! AMA?",

    "comment" : " That was so shit. Can we first set expectations with people before doing these things? Like Imran Khan knows what the reddit audience is like. It's not like Twitter where you give a few curt replies and it's done.  Rana ji writes much words many sentences only in her books. For the online peasants 4 - 5 words max per reply will do. I enjoyed Priyanka Chopra's AMA more than I did that one. That AMA was total shit . I am in future neither gng to read her book nor her stories and i am not a right-winger It has to be one of the worst AMA i have ever seen. Single line single word answers looks like the person was forced to do this.  [deleted] Not understanding the reddit crowd (which loves long, detailed answers) is one thing. She even insulted us when I asked why is she writing one-liners! I think she is a little entitled. I think it wasn't bad. \n\nEven not answering certain questions, giving one liners or cryptic answers or evading the subject tells a lot about the person.  Look on the bright side. The person more or less gave away too much of info about their attitude.\n\n Smaller unknown crowd, may or may not buy book, no mention in media, talk to peasant s? Meh, I will better talk on camera on national TV. Many views. Much talks. Wow attention. So much money.\n\nSecondly, avoiding uncomfortable questions with lame excuses. \n\nNow you know which column or TV show to skip.\n I blame twitter. People have forgotten to be elaborate and expressive. A race to conciseness which carried over to the AMA maybe? Ok quick read through the answers, this was Rampart level shit\n",

He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the \"*monk who sold his Ferrari*\" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  \n\nSo get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. \n\n**Bio:**\n\n>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.\n\n**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.\n\n**Verification**: http://i.imgur.com/T9uPJow.jpg\n",

    "comment" : " I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! \n\nI'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. \n\n\nAlso, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:\n\n1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. \n\n2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?\n\n3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?\n\n4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?\n\n5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?\n\n6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif",

I posted a question in last night's RDD but it was too late so no proper response. \n\nMy friend got married recently and I want to send her a gift. Something that I can buy online and send. Budget 10k - 15k. No appliances. Do you guys have any good gift suggestions? Please be serious. I need help :( \n\nIn other news, Adele's Hello is literally playing fucking everywhere. Is it the same in India too? Like on the radio it plays 3 - 4 times an hour.  [deleted] Hum Farrst! Lol, dunno what to say though, how y'all doing?  Does anyone know about Numbers stations? Anyone interested in conspiracies can look up. Its not a conspiracy really. This shit really exists. A website called the conet project has many recordings of those broadcasts. Do not listen to the Swedish rhapsody. Or do, whatever!

What I got was \"chettinad\"\n\n What's the weirdest dream you've ever had? So normally i use to go out for coffee and talk to everyone. in the last couple of days, it seems i lost my confidence to talk to women and get numbers.. dammed What's the best ISP in Mumbai for Netflix? I'm cutting off my Tata Sky connection so I'm ready to switch to Netflix + better internet. Currently, I don't have broadband internet, so I depend on my Vodafone connection.
